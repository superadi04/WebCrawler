          <p>“My name is Harriet Wilson and I am a junior majoring
          in computer science at the State University of New York
          college at Brockport. I am an African American and will
          be the last one of my mother's 3 children to get a
          college degree.</p>
          <p>“If it wasn�t for scholarships, loans and grants, a
          higher education would have been impossible for me and my
          sisters. My mother is a very hard working individual, but
          she has had a difficult time trying to raise 3 children
          with an income of just under $21,000 a year! I owe a lot
          to this country because the loans and scholarships have
          enabled me to go to college. That is why this election is
          so important.</p>
          <p>“I�m voting for Bill Clinton because he cares about
          people like me. He's not just concerned with a so-called
          15% tax cut that won't help me or my education! We
          definitely need to keep Clinton as president one more
          term if we want a better future for the young people of
          America!”</p>

          <p>“I am a sixty-two-year-old female, the mother of three
          with seven grandchildren, liberal and very proud of it.
          Clinton reminds me so very much of Kennedy, and I loved
          that guy.</p>
          <p>“I support the Clinton/Gore '96 ticket for the
          following reasons:</p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>I support choice for women.</li>
            <li>People aren't standing in soup lines, losing their
            homes and farms, they are working. He has done a
            wonderful job for the economy and unemployment.</li>
            <li>He helped restore democracy to Haiti.</li>
            <li>There was slaughter in Bosnia, I thought that kind
            of killing was over with after Hitler. He stopped
            that!</li>
            <li>He at least got Israelis and Palestinians to talk,
            however I don't think that problem will ever be solved.
            I like his foreign policy.</li>
            <li>Interest rates are low and the stock market is up.
            I like his economic plan.</li>
            <li>He promises not to touch medicare or social
            security.</li>
            <li>I like his education policy.</li>
            <li>I like his enviromental policy.</li>

          <p>“I would like to thank President Clinton for all the
          support he has given Oklahoma since the bombing. He is
          truly a caring man.</p>
          <p>“In April, he visited the University of Central
          Oklahoma, with Mrs. Clinton. I met both of them at their
          one public speech and told them I would work my rear off
          to get him reelected. <img src="ticket.jpg" height="95"

          “The purpose of the President's visit was to spend time
          with victims of the bombing. He and Mrs. Clinton had
          private time with the surviving victims and families of
          those who died. He and the surviving children from
          America's Kids Daycare (destroyed in the bombing) placed
          a wreath on the grounds where the Murrah Building once
          stood. This was not a campaign visit, his focus was on
          the healing of our state.</p>
          <p>“The President has shown us how much he cares about
          the people. Due to his outpouring of support, and from
          those like him, children who survived the bombing will be
          able to go to college with monies donated to a special
          scholarship fund.”</p>

            <p>“My name is Anna Kidman. I am 73, have raised a
            family of 9 children, eight of my own and a foster
            child, who lost her mother shortly after immigrating to
            America from Germany. I volunteer my time at St.
            Vincent de Paul, where I cheer the lonely, feed the
            hungry, and clothe the poor. In January 1995 I became a
            widow when I lost my husband, Terry, to lung
            cancer.</p>
            <p>“Recently, President Clinton's train passed through
            my home town, on his way to the Democratic National
            Convention. When I heard that his train would pass
            through Dowgiac, I encouraged everyone I spoke with to
            come to the train station for a chance to see the
            President. I inherit my passion and activism from my
            father, who immigrated to America from Poland in 1912.
            On election day, my father would put on his suit, go
            door to door, and encourage our friends and neighbors
            to vote. Well, the train came, passed through town, and
            left. We didn't get to see the President. When I told
            my daughter about the train, she said she would e-mail
            the President and ask him for a sign that the average
            person can be heard. So here I am. I was given a chance
            to tell you why I support the President and Mrs.
            Clinton.</p>
            <p>“The President and Mrs. Clinton, Vice President and
            Mrs. Gore, are what's good for America. I believe that
            they have not recieved enough credit for what they have
            done, and continue to do. It takes a lot of courage to
            fight for what's right ... and it takes team effort.
            The policies of your administration are truly focused
            toward the needs of the American people, not only in
            the present, but for generations to come. I admire the
            way the you stood firm in the halls of Congress to
            protect Affirmative Action, Education, Medicare, the
            Environment, Welfare Reform and raising the Minimum
            Wage, which needs to go higher yet. Thank you,
            President Clinton, for taking on the Tobbacco Industry.
            It is a great comfort to me, not only because of the
            loss of my husband, but because I know that you are
            trying to protect my grandchildren, and all children,
            from the destruction caused by addiction to nicotine.
            Yes, it is addictive, even during chemotherapy, my
            husband, Terry, craved cigarettes.</p>
            <p>“Thank you, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. In my
            community work, I am involved with people of all ages,
            races, and walks of life. I know it takes a villiage to
            raise a child. I hate to think of where my
            foster-daughter, Theresa, would be today had we not
            been there for her. There are countless other young
            people that have touched my life through my children.
            Yes, Hillary, you are right, it is not a new idea, but
            a way of living that needs to be emphasized in our
            society as a whole. I am very proud that we have a
            First Lady who is involved in the social issues of the
            day, and actively working to find solutions to social
            needs. Her efforts on behalf of health care reform and
            the President's program to end illiteracy in America
            are two such fine efforts. I know that it is difficult
            to bring about change in a damned if you do damned if
            you don't situation. President Clinton's vision for
            America, and his realistic approach, comes at a crucial
            point in our history. I look forward to seeing you
            re-double your efforts on these and other important
            issues. Keep up the good work!</p>
            <p>“Everyone should remember to vote on November 5!!!
