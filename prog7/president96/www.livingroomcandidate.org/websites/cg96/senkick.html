      <tt><b>VICE PRESIDENT GORE, FIRST LADY HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON
      KICK OFF FORMATION OF "NATIONAL SENIORS COMMITTEE FOR
      CLINTON/GORE" ACTIVITIES HELD IN 35 STATES</b></tt>

    <p><tt>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Vice President Gore and First Lady
    Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined thousands of senior
    citizens across the country to kick-off the "National Seniors
    Committee for Clinton/Gore" effort in all 50 states. Vice
    President Gore was featured at an event in Fort Lauderdale,
    Florida. The First Lady participated in a roundtable discussion
    with seniors in Tucson, Arizona.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>There were activities in 35 states announcing the
    formation of state advisory committees as part of the "National
    Seniors Committee for Clinton/Gore." There will be advisory
    committees in all 50 states. With only 21 days until the
    Election Day, the Seniors Committees will focus on increasing
    senior citizen support for the President and Vice President,
    identifying voters, and informing communities of President
    Clinton and Vice President Gore�s accomplishments.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Vice President Gore praised the "National Seniors
    Committee" team noting that their support is central to the
    re-election effort. "President Clinton and I are pleased to
    have the support of senior citizens across the country. We have
    fought hard to protect seniors and their benefits from
    Republican-backed budget cuts and we are committed to helping
    seniors meet the challenges of the 21st century."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The First Lady spoke of how important initiatives that
    help senior citizens are to the President and the Vice
    President. "This nation maintains its greatness because of the
    contributions of America�s senior citizens. The President and
    Vice President are continuing to build on policies that provide
    older Americans with quality health care, economic security and
    independence."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Participants in Fort Lauderdale pointed out the stark
    differences between President Clinton and Bob Dole on issues of
    concern to seniors. "The President has consistently supported
    initiatives that benefit the nation�s seniors and their
    families while Bob Dole has given lip service to protecting
    programs while cutting them drastically," said Dr. Eugene
    Callender, a National Senior Committee co-chair and former
    Director of the New York State Office for the Aging.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Lou Glasse, former President of the Older Women�s League
    and a Senior Committee co-chair added, �Bob Dole is proud of
    the fact that he opposed the original legislation that created
    Medicare. Dole said, �I was there, fighting the fight, voting
    against Medicare -- one of twelve, because we knew it wouldn�t
    work in 1965.' But Medicare and other programs that ensure the
    health and economic security of older Americans have reduced
    poverty among seniors. What�s more, these programs are also
    widely credited for raising life expectancy of Americans who
    reach 65 to the highest in the world.</tt></p>
