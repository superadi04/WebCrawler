    <p><tt>PRESS RELEASE<br>
    August 10, 1996</tt></p>
    <center>
      <tt>Clinton/Gore �96 Appoints New Assistant Director of
      Public Liaison for Seniors Outreach</tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>The Clinton/Gore �96 campaign announced the appointment
    of Mike Haga as the Director of Seniors Outreach. Haga will act
    as a liaison for seniors; formulate and execute plans to reach
    the nation�s seniors; coordinate Clinton/Gore �96 campaign
    events for seniors; and will be instrumental in the operation
    of the national Clinton/Gore �96 Seniors steering committee to
    be named in September.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Haga has an extensive record of service with senior
    organizations and issues impacting the quality of life of
    senior citizens. He has particular experience in the area of
    health care for seniors, especially the operation of Medicare
    and Medicaid. He worked with the National Health Care Campaign
    in the 80's.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The goal of the senior outreach program is to involve
    seniors in the political process and to highlight issues of
    concern to seniors and their families. "Fortunately, with the
    contrasting records of President Clinton and Bob Dole,
    increased involvement of seniors and more attention to senior
    issues will automatically result in more votes for the
    President," explained Haga.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"From the time Franklin Roosevelt won passage of Social
    Security in 1935, to the time Lyndon Johnson signed the first
    Medicare card for Harry Truman in 1966, through last year�s
    budget battle over the Republican plan to cut Medicare and
    Medicaid to finance tax cuts for the wealthy, Democrats have
    demonstrated their support for programs benefiting seniors and
    their families," said Alan Wheat, Deputy Campaign Manager and
    Director of Public Liaison.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton has demonstrated his personal
    commitment to strengthen the Medicare Trust Fund without
    accepting the increased beneficiary costs proposed by
    Republican leadership; to preserve to Social Security benefits
    and protect against cuts used to finance tax relief for the
    wealthy; to maintain Medicaid coverage of nursing home care and
    continue standards of quality assurance; and to strengthen the
    Older Americans Act and the Senior Service Corps.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"The Clinton Administration has amassed an impressive
    and far-reaching record in serving seniors and their families
    and Mike�s experience with, and dedication to seniors will be a
    tremendous asset to the campaign," Wheat said.</tt></p>
