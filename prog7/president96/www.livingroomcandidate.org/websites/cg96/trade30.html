              North Dakota is the country�s 11th largest
              agricultural exporting state, shipping $1.2 billion
              in agricultural exports abroad or 2.7% of the U.S.
              total in 1994 (latest year available for Department
              of Agriculture state export data). The largest export
              category, wheat, accounted for over 70 percent of
              North Dakota�s agricultural exports in 1994. Given
              the 22 percent increase in total U.S. agriculture
              exports in 1995, agriculture exports from North
              Dakota in 1995 will likely range between $1.4 billion
              and $1.5 billion.
