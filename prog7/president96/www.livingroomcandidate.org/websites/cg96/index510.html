          <p>“I switched political parties between history and
          algebra classes.</p>
          <p>“I have been considering becoming a Democrat for about
          8 years because during that period of time I have felt
          less and less represented by the Republican party and
          more and more that the issues I'm concerned with are
          being addressed by the Democratic party. As a woman, I am
          concerned with minority issues, and as a student, I am
          definitely concerned with education in America.</p>
          <p>“I think President Clinton's program to guarantee two
          years of community college is a good idea. If such a plan
          were implemented, it would put education in the hands
          (and minds) of people who otherwise couldn't afford it.
          Community colleges are more than just technical schools
          these days. They teach life skills. Not only can a person
          learn a trade or complete the first two years of a
          four-year degree at a community college, these
          institutions teach basic literacy, and English as a
          second language. They retrain corporate America.</p>
          <p>“President Clinton visited my college in July. I was
          one of the volunteers from the college who helped the
          presidential staff. The essay on my home page constitutes
          my observations about Clinton's visit and many people
          have found them powerful when combined with the
          photographs that inspired them.”</p>

          <p>“Six years ago, I decided to move to New England in
          1990 to accept a position as a Design Engineer, but
          quickly found myself out of a job as the company had to
          layoff to remain financially solvent. I remained
          unemployed for most of 1991 until finding another
          entry-level position. I worked and trained for this large
          corporation for almost three years before being laid
          off.</p>
          <p>“Before President Clinton's economic leadership, the
          overall perception of a rudderless economic course added
          to the instability in the business community and I
          believe had a direct affect on the working lives of many
          Americans, not just myself. Unemployment and inflation
          was high and business investment in infrastructure and
          new hiring was at a ten year low.</p>

          <p>“ Now, I've been working for a new company in Southern
          New England and I feel less worried about my working
          future. I now have the resources to support a family
          which freed me to marry my long-time girlfriend. I and my
          new wife are now in the process of building a new home in
          a beautiful area of the state.</p>
          <p>“I'm convinced that the President has kept extremists
          from both sides at bay on important social and economic
          issues by compromising when needed to keep us moving
          forward as a country. My wife and I consider ourselves as
          �moderates� and we believe the President and Vice
          President share our core beliefs in family, the
          environment, education, and a stable long-term plan for
          the economy.”</p>

          our environment is the most important issue to me besides
          the education of my 6 year old girl Mariah. The other day
          my daughter asked me if the forests and lakes and rivers
          and air would still be this nice when she grows up. I
          cried and promised her that they would. Please help me to
          keep my promise. Thanks and good luck. Al Gore, I salute
          you as the best and most knowledgable environmental
          leader in the free world. Peace, Hank</p>
