  <blockquote>
    <p>Shiley Theatre, University of San Diego<br>
    San Diego, CA</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Good evening from the Shiley Theatre at the
    University of San Diego, San Diego, California. I'm Jim Lehrer
    of the NewsHour on PBS. Welcome to this second 1996
    Presidential Debate between Senator Bob Dole, the Republican
    nominee, and President Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee. It
    is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.</p>
    <p>We will follow a town hall type format tonight. The
    questions over the next 90 minutes will come from 113 citizens
    of the greater San Diego area. They were chosen in the past
    week by the Gallup organization to represent a rough
    cross-section of voters as to political views, age, gender, and
    other factors. Each said he or she is undecided about this
    presidential race.</p>
    <p>They were told to come tonight with questions; nobody from
    the Debate Commission or the two campaigns has any idea what
    those questions are. Neither do I. We will all be hearing them
    for the first time at the same time. I met with this group
    three hours ago, and we spoke only about how it was going to
    work tonight. They are sitting in five sections. I will call on
    individuals at random, moving from one section to another with
    each new question, alternating the questions between the two
    candidates. My job is to keep things fair and the subjects as
    clear and as varied as possible.</p>
    <p>The rules, drawn by the campaigns, are basically the same as
    they were for the Hartford and St. Petersburg debates
    --90-second answers; 60-second rebuttals; 30-second responses
    for each question. The candidates are not allowed to question
    each other directly. There will be two-minute opening and
    closing statements. The order for this evening was set by coin
    toss.</p>
    <p>We begin now with Senator Dole and his opening statement.
    Senator Dole.</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Thank you very much, Jim. Let me first give
    you a sports update: The Braves 1, Cardinals nothing -- early
    on. (Laughter.)</p>
    <p>I want to thank you, and I want to thank everybody here
    tonight. I want a special thanks to my wife, Elizabeth, and my
    daughter, Robin, for their love and support, and thank the
    people who are listening and watching all over America.</p>
    <p>In 20 days you will help decide who lead this country into
    the next century. It's an awesome responsibility. And you must
    ask yourself, do you know enough about the candidates. You
    should know as much as possible about each of us. Sometimes the
    views have been distorted. There has been millions and millions
    of dollars in negative advertising spent distorting my views.
    But I hope tonight you'll get a better feel of who Bob Dole is
    and what he's all about.</p>
    <p>And I think first I should understand the question on your
    mind is, do I understand your problems. What I understand is --
    it occurred to me, and I might just say that I'm from a large
    family, I've got lots of relatives, and they're good, average,
    middle-class, hard-working Americans. They live all across the
    country. They're not all Republicans. Maybe all but one.
    (Laughter.)</p>
    <p>But in any event, I understand the problems -- whether it's
    two parents working because one has to pay the taxes and one
    has to provide for the family; whether it's a single parent who
    just barely pays the pressing bills; or whether you're worried
    about an education for your children, going to the best
    schools; or whether you're worried about safe playgrounds,
    drug-free schools, crime-free schools. This is what this
    election is all about.</p>
    <p>And, hopefully, tonight when we conclude this debate, you
    will have a better understanding, and the viewing and listening
    audience will have a better understanding. Thank you.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. President, two minutes. Opening
    statement.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: I was going to applaud, too. (Laughter.)
    Well, thank you, Jim, and thanks to the people of San Diego for
    giving this opportunity to have another discussion about the
    decision we all face, in front of people who will make the
    decisions.</p>
    <p>Again, I will say I'll do my best to make this a discussion
    of ideas and issues, not insults. What really matters is what
    happens to your future and what happens to our country as we
    stand on the brink of a new century, a time of extraordinary
    possibility.</p>
    <p>I have a simple philosophy that I've tried to follow for the
    last four years -- do what creates opportunity for all, what
    reinforces responsibility from all of us, and what will help us
    build a community where everybody has got a role to play and a
    place at the table.</p>
    <p>Compared to four years ago, we're clearly better off. We've
    got 10.5 million more jobs. The deficit's been reduced by 60
    percent. Incomes are rising for the first time in a decade. The
    crime rates and the welfare rolls are falling. We're putting
    100,000 more police on the streets, 60,000 felons, fugitives
    and stalkers have been denied handguns.</p>
    <p>But that progress is only the beginning. What we really
    should focus on tonight is what we still have to do to help the
    American people make the most of this future that's out there.
    I think what really matters is what we can do to help build
    strong families. Strong families mean a strong economy. To me,
    that means we have to go on and balance this budget while we
    protect Medicare and Medicaid and education and the
    environment.</p>
    <p>We should give a tax cut, targeted to child-rearing and
    education, to buying a first home and paying for health care.
    We ought to help protect our kids from drugs and guns and gangs
    and tobacco. We ought to help move a million people from
    welfare to work. And we ought to create the finest education
    system in the world, where every 18-year-old can go on to
    college and all of our younger children have great educational
    opportunities. If we do those things, we can build that bridge
    to the 21st century. That's what I hope to get to talk about
    tonight.</p>
    <p>Thank you.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Let's go now to the first question from this
    section, and it's for Senator Dole.</p>
    <p>Q Hello, Senator Dole.</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Hi.</p>
    <p>Q I'm a beginning educator in this country and I really
    think it's important what children have to say. They're still
    very idealistic and everything they say comes from the
    heart.</p>
    <p>I have a quote for you from, "If I Were President," compiled
    by Peggy Gavin. A 6th-grader says, "If I were President I would
    think about Abraham Lincoln and George Washington and what they
    did to make our country great. We should unite the white and
    black people and people of all cultures. Democrats and
    Republicans should unite also. We should all come together and
    think of the best ways to solve the economic problems of our
    country. I believe that when we are able to come together and
    stop fighting amongst ourselves we will get along a lot
    better."</p>
    <p>These are the ideals and morals that we are trying to teach
    our children in these days. Yet, we don't seem to be practicing
    them in our government, in anything. If you are President, how
    will you begin to practice what we are preaching to our
    children, the future of our nation?</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Well, I'll just say, first of all, I think
    it's a very good question. I appreciate the quote from the
    young man.</p>
    <p>There's no doubt about it that many American people have
    lost their faith in government. They see scandals almost on a
    daily basis. They see ethical problems in the White House
    today. They see 900 FBI files of private persons being gathered
    up by somebody in the White House. Nobody knows who hired this
    man. So that there is a great deal of cynicism out there.</p>
    <p>What I've always tried in whatever I've done, is to bring
    people together. I said in my acceptance speech in San Diego
    about two months ago that the exits are clearly marked: if you
    think the Republican Party is someplace for you to come if
    you're narrow-minded or bigoted or don't like certain people in
    America, the exits are clearly marked for you to walk out of,
    as I stand here without compromise, because this is the party
    of Lincoln.</p>
    <p>I think we have a real obligation -- obviously, public
    officials -- I'm no longer a public official. I left public
    life on June 11 of this year. But it is very important -- young
    people are looking to us. They're looking to us for leadership.
    They're watching what we do, what we say, what we promise, and
    what we finally deliver. And I would think, it seems to me that
    there are opportunities here -- when I'm President of the
    United States, I will keep my word. My word is my bond.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. President.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: One of the reasons that I ran for
    President is because not just children, a lot of grownups felt
    that way. If you remember, four years ago we had not only
    rising unemployment, but a lot of rising cynicism. I had never
    worked in Washington as an elected official. It seemed to me
    that most of the arguments were partisan --
    Republican-Democrat, left-right, liberal-conservative.</p>
    <p>That's why I said tonight I'm for opportunity,
    responsibility, and community. And we've gotten some real
    progress in the last four years. I've also done everything I
    could at every moment of division in this country -- after
    Oklahoma City, when these churches were burned -- to bring
    people together and remind people that we are stronger because
    of our diversity. We have to respect one another.</p>
    <p>You mentioned Washington and Lincoln; they were Presidents
    at historic times. This is an historic time. It's important
    that we go beyond those old partisan arguments and focus on
    people and their future. When we do that, instead of shutting
    the government down over a partisan fight on the budget, we're
    a better country, and that's why we're making progress now.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Senator?</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Well, bringing people together again is
    obviously a responsibility we all have. I know you do it,
    everybody here does it. We do a lot of things nobody knows
    about. I have a little foundation for the disabled, called the
    Dole Foundation. We've raised about $10 million. We don't talk
    about it. We try to help people with disabilities, bring them
    back into the mainstream of public life.</p>
    <p>So it seems to me that there's also a public trust. When
    you're the President of the United States you have a public
    trust, and you have to keep that public trust, as George
    Washington, as Abraham Lincoln did. And I think now that trust
    is being violated, and it seems to me we ought to face up to
    it, and the President ought to say tonight that he's not going
    to pardon anybody that he was involved in business with who
    might implicate him later on.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: All right. The next question from this second
    right here. Right there in the middle, sir.</p>
    <p>Q Mr. President, I'd like to know if you would please
    explain your plans for -- in a substantive fashion for
    addressing the problems of the health care system in our
    country.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: I will. First of all, let me say what we
    have done. In the last four years, we've worked hard to promote
    more competition to bring down the rate of inflation in health
    care costs without eroding health care quality. The government
    pays for Medicare and Medicaid as you know, and that's very
    important.</p>
    <p>Secondly, we've added a million more children to the ranks
    of the insured through the Medicaid program. We have protected
    25 million people through the passage of the Kennedy-Kassebaum
    bill that says you can't lose your health insurance if you
    change jobs or if someone in your family has been sick. We just
    recently ended those drive-by deliveries, saying people
    couldn't be kicked out of the hospital by insurance companies
    when they just had babies.</p>
    <p>So that's a good start. In the next four years I want to
    focus on the following things. Number one, add another million
    children to the insured ranks through the Medicaid program.
    Number two, keep working with the states, as we are now, to add
    2.2 million more people to the insured system. Number three,
    cover people who are between jobs for up to six months. That
    could protect 3 million families, 700,000 kids. And, number
    four, make sure we protect the integrity of the Medicare
    program and the Medicaid program, and not do anything in
    cutting costs which would cause hundreds of hospitals to close,
    which could have been the case if the $270 billion Medicare cut
    that I vetoed had been enacted into law.</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Just let me say, there you go again, Mr.
    President, talking about a Medicare cut. Now, I've heard you
    say this time after time. And I've heard you say on one TV
    appearance, the media made me do it. You're trying to defend
    your cut -- which was not a cut, either -- reduction in the
    growth of spending. And we always had at least a seven percent.
    You've said publicly that it's now three times the rate of
    inflation. We ought to cut the growth to twice the rate of
    inflation. It's about where we are now.</p>
    <p>Let's stop talking about cutting Medicare, and my economic
    plan will increase it 39 percent. Don't forget what he tried to
    do with health care. Seventeen new taxes, spend $1.5 trillion,
    50 new bureaucracies. Can you believe that? You couldn't have
    even been a cardiologist because they had quotas. Your --
    cardiology wouldn't affect you, but if somebody wanted to be a
    cardiologist 10 years from now you'd have to be certain you
    complied with some of the rules in this extreme medical plan
    the government was going to take over for all America.</p>
    <p>There are things we can do, like the Kassebaum bill, which
    contains many provisions I authored, covered preexisting
    conditions, portability. And there are other things we should
    do. We still need to cover about 20 million people and a lot of
    children.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: I don't have time in 30 seconds to
    respond to fix all that, but let me just say, the American
    Hospital Association said that the budget I vetoed could have
    closed 700 hospitals, not me. And on a per-person basis, it did
    cut way below the rate of inflation in medical costs.</p>
    <p>But the important thing is, what are we going to do now. We
    need to help people who are between jobs. We need to cover more
    kids. We need to provide more preventive care. My balanced
    budget covers mammograms for ladies on -- women on Medicare,
    and also gives respite care to the million-plus families who
    have someone with Alzheimer's. These things are paid for in the
    balanced budget plan. It will move us forward.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Next question is for Senator Dole, from here.
    Yes, sir.</p>
    <p>Q I am active-duty military and a small business owner. My
    question is, what is your position on closing the gap between
    military and civilian pay scales?</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Jason, I appreciate that very much, being a
    former military man myself. You know, we have 17,000 men and
    women today wearing our uniforms that receive food stamps. That
    shouldn't happen in America. We have men and women wearing our
    uniforms in substandard housing. It shouldn't happen in
    America. And it's a time we take a look at the pay scales. Did
    get a 3 percent increase this year, but that's not enough.</p>
    <p>If we're going to ask young men and young women to protect
    us and defend us around the world -- and we've had more
    deployments under this administration than any time in history.
    Fifty times we deployed troops around the world. Every time you
    do that you take a risk. Somebody you know, maybe your son,
    maybe your grandson, maybe somebody else. So I think anybody
    who wears uniforms is a great American.</p>
    <p>Remember Vietnam. Remember when people almost used to walk
    across the street rather than have contact with somebody who
    was in Vietnam. That's all behind us now, and it should be
    behind us. And the "forgotten war," the Korean War. But I guess
    I can just answer you very plainly, Jason. Thank you for doing
    what you're doing. America owes you a debt of gratitude.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: May I ask you a question? What service
    are you in?</p>
    <p>Q I'm in the United States Navy, sir.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: And what kind of small business do you
    have?</p>
    <p>Q I have an Amway business.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: Good for you.</p>
    <p>Let me say -- Senator Dole mentioned this -- I just signed a
    bill that we got through Congress to increase the amount of pay
    increase we could give for military personnel and to make sure
    the pay increase this year was above the rate of inflation. I
    also have presented to the Congress and they adopted a large
    package of quality of life improvements, which are very
    important.</p>
    <p>I've spent a lot of time talking to military families as
    well as military members all over the world and in bases all
    across the United States. And I became convinced, after talking
    to the families and the personnel in uniform that we needed to
    not only have the pay raise, but we needed to invest more in
    child care, housing and other things to support families,
    especially when they are longer deployments because of the
    downsizing of the military.</p>
    <p>We're going to do better and we'll do better still. But this
    is a commitment I think that all Americans share without regard
    to party.</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: I don't disagree with anything the President
    said, except he waited four years to do these things. And my
    view is, it will be done on day one. We'll start working on it
    on day one in the Dole-Kemp administration. This is important.
    We only have 10 divisions now; we used to have 18. We had 25
    fighter wings; we're down to 13. We had 536 ships, we're down
    to 336 ships. I mean, we've cut defense spending too much in
    the first place.</p>
    <p>The President told you in '92 he would cut it $67 billion;
    he cut $112 billion. We're right on the edge right now. But the
    last thing we ought to do is make those who wear the uniforms
    sacrifice.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Next question here for President Clinton. Yes,
    ma'am, here on the front row.</p>
    <p>Q President Clinton, yesterday, Yasser Arafat said in
    Palestine that he thinks the key to success in the Middle East
    is the commitment of Americans. Would you, as President, send
    American troops to Israel or the West Bank as peacekeepers?</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: Let me just take two seconds of my time,
    because I'm the Commander-In-Chief, to respond to one thing
    that was said. I propose to spend $1.6 trillion on defense
    between now and the year 2002, and there's less than one
    percent difference between my budget and the Republican budget
    on defense.</p>
    <p>Now, on the Middle East -- as you know, I've worked very
    hard for peace in the Middle East. The agreement between the
    Palestinians and the Israelis was signed at the White House and
    the agreement, the peace treaty with Jordan, I went to Jordan
    to sign that, to be there. And I think the United States can do
    whatever we reasonably can.</p>
    <p>I can say this, I do not believe Yasser Arafat wants us to
    send troops to the West Bank. We've never been asked to send
    troops to the West Bank. I saw the agreement that Prime
    Minister Rabin and Yasser Arafat signed on the West Bank. It
    had 26 separate maps they had to sign -- literally thousands of
    delineations of who would do what on the West Bank. And I
    believe if the parties will get together and in a good-faith
    manner make that agreement, that they'll be able to do it. We
    cannot impose a peace on the Middle East.</p>
    <p>My position has always been that the job of the United
    States was to minimize the risks of peace. If they ask me to be
    part of some monitoring force, as we are in the Sinai and have
    been since 1978, to monitor the peace between Egypt and Israel,
    frankly, I would have to think about it, I would have to see
    what they wanted to do. But I don't believe that will be the
    request. I think what Mr. Arafat wants us to do is to make sure
    that everybody honors the agreements they've already made.
    That's why I brought the leaders to Washington a few days ago.
    I think they will and I think we'll get there. Don't be too
    discouraged.</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Let me, Jason, come back to you a minute,
    because there is a big difference in the defense budget. We had
    $7 billion this year and $10 billion more than the President.
    He puts his money in the out-years. Even if he were reelected,
    he would be gone before anything happened, and nothing is going
    to happen because we don't have modernization now. If we don't
    build more B-2 bombers in California -- we lost about 500,000
    jobs out in California because of this devastation, these big,
    big cuts. We had to make cuts; we didn't have to make the cuts
    the President promised he'd make, then he doubled. And so I
    think we need to go back and take a look.</p>
    <p>We're increasing defense reasonably, not too much, but we
    are increasing defense some because we want to be prepared in
    case somebody here gets called up, Jason.</p>
    <p>I would say -- I didn't hear what Yasser Arafat had to say,
    but I don't want to -- you know, I think foreign policy I'm
    going to be very careful about. And I'm not here to argue about
    the President on some ongoing foreign policy matter. What I
    want the President to do -- I think he may have done it in the
    last statement -- call for an unconditional end to the violence
    and have the parties keep on talking, as they should talk and
    have a resolution. The last thing we want to do is commit more
    forces anywhere. But let's sort of keep this out of politics
    because it's pretty dicey right now.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: When the change of government occurred in
    Israel, the people of Israel were saying, we don't want to
    abandon the peace process, we want more security. Then, a lot
    of mutual distrust developed, a lot of things happened which
    maybe shouldn't have happened.</p>
    <p>When I asked Yasser Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu to
    come to Washington and got them together and they talked alone
    for three hours, I was convinced that they had to have a chance
    to make that peace. Again, I say, if they ask us to play some
    reasonable role, I don't know how I would respond to it, but it
    would depend entirely on what they asked us to do.</p>
    <p>But the real secret there is for them to abide by the
    agreements they've made and find a way to trust each other. And
    they're going to have to spend some time and trust each other.
    Prime Minister Rabin gave his life believing that that trust
    could be materialized, and I still think it can be.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: All right, next question from this section and
    it is for Senator Dole. Back in the back. Yes, sir. Right
    there. Yes, sir.</p>
    <p>Q Senator Dole, I'm an ex-smoker for 30 years. Thirty years
    ago, I was a pack-plus-a-day man, okay. You mentioned in your
    statement, you said some time ago that you didn't think
    nicotine was addictive. Are you still holding to that
    statement, or do you wish to recant or explain yourself?</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Oh, that's very easy. My record, going back to
    1965 in the Congress, the first vote we had was whether or not
    you should put a little notice on cigarettes -- they may be --
    I voted for -- I voted for everything since that time.</p>
    <p>In fact, 1992, we had a bill come before us that all the
    states had to comply or they're going to lose certain money. We
    sent it to the Clinton administration for implementation. They
    waited three and a half years, and during that period about
    3,000 young kids every day started smoking. So you add it up;
    that's about 3 million.</p>
    <p>Not until again in 1996 -- I don't want anybody to smoke. My
    brother probably died partly because of cigarettes. I was asked
    a technical question: Are they addictive. Maybe -- they
    probably are addictive. I don't know, I'm not a doctor. You
    shouldn't smoke. You ought to be glad you quit, Oscar. Thirty
    years?</p>
    <p>And it seems to me that what we need to do is to talk about
    not only tobacco, but drugs, because drug use with 12-to
    17-year-olds has doubled in this administration, the last 44
    months. Marijuana use is up 141 percent; cocaine use up 160
    percent. They're your kids. It's all happened in this
    administration because they cut funding and they cut
    interdiction.</p>
    <p>When I'm President of the United States, we're going to use
    the National Guard and whatever sources we need to stop some of
    the drugs coming into America. If you stop the drugs, nobody is
    going to use the drugs. So don't smoke, don't drink, don't use
    drugs. Just don't do it.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: Oscar, the question of what the federal
    government should do to limit the access of tobacco to young
    people is one of the biggest differences between Senator Dole
    and me.</p>
    <p>We did propose a regulation six months after I became
    President under the law he mentioned. It simply says all these
    states that made it illegal for kids to smoke, now they have to
    try harder if they want to keep getting federal funds. Then we
    took comments, as we always do, and there were tens of
    thousands of comments about how we ought to do it. That's what
    drug it out.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, we started, also in '93, to look into whether
    cigarettes were addictive enough for the federal Food and Drug
    Administration to ban the ability of cigarette companies to
    advertise, market and distribute tobacco products to our kids.
    No President had ever taken on the tobacco lobby before. I did.
    Senator Dole opposed me. He went down and made a speech to
    people who were on his side saying that I did the wrong thing.
    I think I did the right thing.</p>
    <p>On drugs, I have repeatedly said drugs are wrong and illegal
    and can kill you. We have strengthened enforcement and
    everybody in San Diego knows we've strengthened control of the
    border. We've done a lot more. I hope we get a chance to talk
    about it.</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Well, they also know if they live in San
    Diego, Mr. President, you're caught with 125 pounds of
    marijuana or less you go back to Mexico, you're not prosecuted.
    You have a U.S. attorney here that sends them back home. So I
    think that's pretty important. That's a lot of marijuana.
    That's a big supply.</p>
    <p>But don't -- you know, don't get into this smoke-screen
    here, Oscar. The President in the election year decided, well,
    I ought to do something. I haven't done anything on drugs. I've
    been AWOL for 44 months, so let's take on smoking. But, see,
    they haven't even done it. They haven't said what's going to
    happen, whether they're going to have it declared addictive. It
    could apply just to -- once it's a drug, does it apply only to
    teenagers or to everybody in America?</p>
    <p>Nobody should smoke, young or old, but particularly young
    people should not smoke. And my record is there, it's been
    there. I voted eight, 10 times since 1965.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Next question is for President Clinton and it
    comes from right here. Yes, sir.</p>
    <p>Q President Clinton, I'm a retired Air Force pilot. Sir,
    it's officially forecast that our annual Medicare and Social
    Security deficits are measured in the trillions of dollars in
    the next century. Depending on who you listen to, Social
    Security will be bankrupt in either 2025 or 2030. I feel it is
    grossly unfair, especially to our younger generations who are
    losing faith in the system.</p>
    <p>My question is this: Assuming you agree that our entitlement
    programs are at an unsustainable course, what specific reforms
    do you propose?</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: First of all, they're two different
    things: Social Security and Medicare are entirely different in
    terms of the financial stability. Let's talk about them
    separately.</p>
    <p>Social Security is stable until, as you pointed out, at
    least the third decade of the next century. But we would like
    to have a Social Security fund that has about 70 years of life
    instead of about 30 years of life.</p>
    <p>What we have to do is simply to make some adjustments that
    take account of the fact that the baby boomers, people like me,
    are bigger in number than the people that went just before us
    and the people that come just after us. And I think what we'll
    plainly do is what we did in 1983 when Senator Dole served --
    and this is something I think he did a good job on, when he
    served on the Social Security Commission and they made some
    modest changes in Social Security to make sure that it would be
    alive and well into the 21st century.</p>
    <p>And we will do that. It's obvious that there are certain
    things that have to be done and there are 50 or 60 different
    options, and a bipartisan commission to take it out of politics
    will make recommendations and build support for the people.</p>
    <p>Medicare is different. Medicare needs help now. I have
    proposed a budget which would put 10 years on the life of the
    Medicare trust fund. That's more than it's had a lot of the
    time for the last 20 years. It will save a lot of money through
    more managed care, but giving more options, more preventive
    care, and lowering the inflation rate in the prices we're
    paying providers, without having the kind of big premium
    increases and out-of-pocket costs that the budget I vetoed
    would provide.</p>
    <p>Then that will give us 10 years to do with Medicare what
    we're going to do with Social Security -- have a bipartisan
    group, look at what we have to do to save it when the baby
    boomers retire. But now we ought to pass this budget and put 10
    years on it right away so no one has to worry about it.</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Well, again, if you're somebody thinking about
    the future, I think it's fair to say that it will be -- we'll
    work it out. This is a political year and the President is
    playing politics with Medicare, but after this year is over,
    we'll resolve it just as we did with Social Security in 1983,
    with a nonpartisan commission. Ronald Reagan got together with
    Tip O'Neill and Howard Baker, two Republicans and one Democrat.
    They appointed a commission. I was on that commission. We
    resolved -- we rescued Social Security.</p>
    <p>We suggested, I think it's been over a year ago now, we do
    the same with Medicare, and the White House called it a
    gimmick. Now, last week, I guess it was, Donna Shalala said,
    well, we'll cut Medicare $100 billion and appoint a
    commission.</p>
    <p>It will probably have to be done by a commission. Take it
    out of politics. I think if I were a senior citizen, I'd be a
    little fed up with all these ads scaring seniors, scaring
    veterans and scaring students about education. When you don't
    have any ideas, you don't have any agenda, and all you have is
    fear, that's all you can use. We have ideas in the Dole-Kemp
    campaign, and we'll rescue Medicare as we did Social
    Security.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: Their idea was to have the poorest
    seniors in the country pay $270 more a year this year. Their
    idea was a budget that the American Hospital Association said
    could close 700 hospitals. Their idea was to charge everybody
    more out-of-pocket costs in their budget that I vetoed -- not
    in an election, sir, I told them in early 1995.</p>
    <p>Senator Dole said 30 years ago he was one of 12 people that
    voted against Medicare and he was proud of it. A year ago he
    said, "I was right then, I knew it wouldn't work." American
    seniors have the highest life expectancy in the world. We need
    to reform it, not wreck it.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Next question from here, and it's for Senator
    Dole. Yes, ma'am, right here.</p>
    <p>Q Senator Dole, I would like to know what would be your
    first step in reforming welfare.</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Well, we've taken the first step -- took three
    steps. Twice we sent welfare reform to the President and he
    vetoed it. On the third time we sent welfare reform to the
    President he signed it, but announced he would change it next
    year. And the Vice President said they were going to do
    something else through the line item veto, which I've never
    understood, but that's sort of inside baseball.</p>
    <p>What we need to do is make certain we try to return people
    to work. And I'm standing here as someone who a long time ago,
    as a county attorney in Russell, Kansas -- one of our jobs
    every month was to do all the welfare checks and sign them. And
    three of those checks were my grandparents. So I know what it's
    like to have to look welfare head on.</p>
    <p>Obviously, some people are going to need help. This is the
    United States of America. You're not going to go without food
    and you're not going to go without medical care. This is
    America. But at the same time, if you want to get off Medicare,
    get back in the mainstream, we're going to provide jobs. We're
    going to say you have a five-year limit you can be on welfare,
    you've got two years to look for a job. We provided more money
    for day care in a bill that passed the Senate, was vetoed, then
    it came back. The President signed pretty much the same
    bill.</p>
    <p>But this is an important issue. I don't think we ought to be
    giving welfare payments to illegal immigrants. And it puts a
    heavy burden on a state like -- except for emergencies. It puts
    a heavy burden on states like California. It costs California
    taxpayers $3 billion a year.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: President Clinton.</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: I'll get out of your way here.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: It's illegal right now and has been for
    years for illegal immigrants to get welfare benefits.</p>
    <p>Let me say that this is one of the most important issues in
    the world to me. I started working on welfare reform in 1980
    because I was sick of seeing people trapped in a system that
    was increasingly physically isolating them and making their
    kids more vulnerable to get in trouble. So I've been working on
    it when I was governor for a long time. When I became
    President, I used the authority I had in this law to get out
    from under certain federal rules to help states move people to
    work. We've reduced welfare rolls by 2 million already.</p>
    <p>Now, I've got a plan with this new welfare reform law to
    work with the private sector to give private employers specific
    tax incentives to hire people off welfare and to do some other
    things which will create more jobs in the private sector, at
    least a million, to move more people from welfare to work. It's
    very important. And I hope we get a chance to talk about this
    more. There is not a more important issue.</p>
    <p>I still remember a woman that I met 10 years ago who said
    she wanted to get off welfare so her kids could tell -- give an
    answer when they say "what does your mother do for a job." I
    met that woman again. She's got four kids; one has got a good
    job, one is studying to be a doctor, one is in technical
    school, one is an honor student in high school. I want to make
    more people like that woman, Lilly Harden. So I've got a plan
    to do it, and it's just beginning.</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Well, another thing we can do -- we talk about
    growth -- we've got a great economic package, which I hope we
    will discuss later -- an across-the-board tax cut, child
    credit, $500 per child under 18, reduce the capital gains rate,
    create more jobs and opportunities for people on and off
    welfare.</p>
    <p>We have other provisions. Less litigation. The trial lawyers
    -- big supporters of the President. The trial lawyers, of
    course they like lawsuits. Every time they have a bill on veto,
    the President vetoes it for them.</p>
    <p>We've got to understand in America that we've got to have
    growth, create more jobs and more opportunities in the private
    sector. The President takes credit for all of these people off
    welfare -- the governors did that. Federal government doesn't
    do that. And the government doesn't create jobs, they're
    created in the private sector.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: This section. Question. Yes, ma'am on the back
    row. This is for the President.</p>
    <p>Q Mr. President, I'm a landlord. My question is, does your
    party have any future plans to reduce the capital gains tax,
    especially for retired Americans?</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: First of all, we have a big plan to
    reduce capital gains tax when people sell their homes. Part of
    my tax package which is paid for in my balanced budget plan
    would exempt up to half a million dollars in gains for people
    when they sell their home, which I think is the biggest capital
    gains we could give to most ordinary Americans.</p>
    <p>We also have a capital gains now for people that invest in
    new small businesses and hold the investment for five years. It
    was part of our other economic plan. And these are things I
    think that will go a long way toward helping America build a
    stronger economy and a better tax system.</p>
    <p>I think the most important thing to emphasize, though, is
    that we also have to help people in other ways to build a
    stronger economy. And we can't have any tax cut that's not paid
    for.</p>
    <p>One of the big differences between Senator Dole and myself
    is that I told you how I'm going to pay for every penny of the
    tax cuts I recommend. We've worked hard to bring this deficit
    down, and that's helped people in the real estate business,
    because the interest rates are lower. We've got home ownership
    at a 15-year high. We've got this country going in the right
    direction.</p>
    <p>So we can have a tax cut, but my priority would be to help
    the families who need it with child rearing and education and
    buying a first-time home, and helping for health care costs. So
    from you business, helping in buying the first-time home,
    exempting the capital gains on the sale of the home would be
    the most important things that you asked about.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Senator Dole.</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: What the President didn't tell you is that all
    his tax cuts expire in the year 2000, but all his increases go
    on forever. That's the liberal approach. You know, give you a
    little tax cut, give you a couple years; then make the tax
    increases go on forever. So the net tax increase in his plan is
    somewhere between $60 billion and $80 billion.</p>
    <p>We have in the Dole-Kemp economic plan -- unless your home
    is worth over $500,000 -- and if it is, I appreciate it,
    congratulate you -- but in any event, no taxes. And it's a good
    idea. They saw it and picked it up and put in theirs, but it's
    only temporary. Ours is permanent.</p>
    <p>Ours is a good plan -- create jobs and opportunities.
    Capital gains rate, cut it in half, cut it from 28 percent to
    14 percent. There are $7 trillion in assets locked up in
    America. If we cut the capital gains rate -- I'm told every
    day, I got a letter from a former constituent in Kansas saying,
    I want to sell property in California, put it in my business in
    Kansas. I can't because the capital gains rate is too high.</p>
    <p>We need to get the economy going. That will help Social
    Security. That will create more jobs. That will help people who
    want to get off welfare. It's the American way.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: Before Senator Dole left the Senate, he
    and Mr. Gingrich also were recommending that we pass these tax
    cuts only insofar as we could pay for them. And we all assume
    that the tax cuts will be permanent, but we have to prove we
    can pay for them.</p>
    <p>After he left the Senate, we abandoned that. That's why most
    experts say that this tax scheme will blow a huge hole in the
    deficit, raise interest rates and weaken the economy. And that
    will take away all the benefits of the tax cut with a weaker
    economy. That's why we have to balance the budget. And I'll
    tell you how I'm going to pay for anything I promise you
    line-by-line. You should expect that from both of us.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: All right. The next question is for Senator
    Dole. Yes, ma'am, right there.</p>
    <p>Q I'm a third-year student at U.C.-San Diego. And I just
    want to say that it's a great honor representing the voices of
    America. My question is concerning you, Mr. Dole. All the
    controversy regarding your age, how do you feel you can respond
    to young voices of America today and tomorrow?</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Well, I think age is very -- you know, wisdom
    comes from age, experience and intelligence. And if you have
    some of each -- and I have some age, some experience, some
    intelligence -- (laughter) -- that adds up to wisdom.</p>
    <p>I think it also is a strength, it's an advantage. And I have
    a lot of young people work in my office, work in my campaign.
    Now, this is about America. This is about -- somebody said
    earlier, one of the first questions, we're together. It's one
    America, one nation.</p>
    <p>I'm looking at our economic plan because I'm concerned about
    the future for young people. I'm looking about drugs. The
    President's been AWOL for four years. I'm looking about crime.
    He'll claim credit now for crime going down, but it happens
    because mayors and governors and others have brought crime
    down. Rudy Giuliani, Mayor of New York, brought crime down 25
    percent just in New York City. But, of course, the President
    will take credit for that.</p>
    <p>My view is, we want to find jobs and opportunities and
    education. This year, the Republican Congress -- student loans
    went from $24 billion to $36 billion over the next six years --
    a 50-percent increase. It's the highest appropriation ever --
    $6 billion for Pell Grants -- very, very important. We've also
    raised the amount of each Pell Grant.</p>
    <p>In our economic plan, the $500 child credit can be used for
    young people -- rolled over and over and over. Of course, not
    this age, but if you have a child two years old, seven percent
    interest, it will be worth about $18,000 by the time that child
    is ready for college.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: I can only tell you that I don't think
    Senator Dole is too old to be president. It's the age of his
    ideas that I question. You're almost not old enough to remember
    this, but we've tried this before, promising people an election
    year tax cut that's not paid for.</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: We tried it last time you were in.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: Tell them they can have everything you've
    got. And let me just say this. Did you hear him say that
    Congress just voted to increase student loans and scholarships?
    They did after he left. The last budget he led cut Pell Grants,
    cut student loans, I vetoed it when they shut the government
    down.</p>
    <p>My plan would give students a dollar-for-dollar reduction
    for the cost of a typical community college tuition, a $10,000
    deduction a year for the cost of college tuition, would let
    families save in an IRA and withdraw tax-free to pay for the
    cost of education. And it's all paid for.</p>
    <p>My whole administration is about your future. It's about
    what the 21st century is going to be like for you. And I hope
    you'll look at the ideas in it. Thank you.</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Well, when you don't have any ideas, I guess
    just say the other person's ideas are old. As I said earlier,
    they don't have any ideas. Their idea is to raise taxes and
    spend more money. That's the liberal philosophy. If that's what
    you like, you've got a perfect candidate.</p>
    <p>When President Clinton came to California in 1992, he said
    the centerpiece of my first four years is going to be a middle
    class tax cut. All of you who got that tax cut, congratulations
    -- because you got a big tax increase. You got a $265-billion
    tax increase. And he stands here and says, politicians who make
    promises like that ought to be ignored. Well, he made the
    promise. I keep my word. And you'll have a tax cut. It will
    help you in whatever you're going to do in the next few
    years.</p>
    <p>Thank you.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: The next question is for President Clinton and
    it's from -- yes, ma'am.</p>
    <p>Q My question is, do you feel that America has grown enough
    and has educated itself enough to totally cut out affirmative
    action?</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: No, ma'am, I don't. I am against quotas.
    I'm against giving anybody any kind of preference for something
    they're not qualified for. But because I still believe that
    there is some discrimination and that not everybody has an
    opportunity to prove they're qualified, I favor the right kind
    of affirmative action.</p>
    <p>I've done more to eliminate programs and to erase
    affirmative action programs I didn't think were fair and to
    tighten others up than my predecessors have, since affirmative
    action has been around. But I have also worked hard to give
    people the chance to prove that there are qualified.</p>
    <p>Let me just give you some examples. We've doubled the number
    of loans from the Small Business Administration, tripled the
    number of loans to women business people -- no one unqualified.
    Everybody had to meet the standards. We've opened 260,000 new
    jobs in the military to women since I've been President, but
    the Joint Chiefs say we're stronger and more competent and
    solid than ever.</p>
    <p>And let me give you another example of what I mean. To me,
    affirmative action is making that extra effort. It's sort of
    like what Senator Dole did when he sponsored the Americans With
    Disabilities Act and said to certain stores, okay, you've got
    to make it accessible to people in wheelchairs. We weren't
    guaranteeing anything -- anybody anything, except the chance to
    prove they were qualified, the chance to prove that they could
    do it.</p>
    <p>And that's why I must say I agree with General Colin Powell,
    that we're not there yet. We ought to keep making those extra
    effort affirmative action programs the law and the policy of
    the land.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Senator Dole.</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Well, we may not be there yet, but we're not
    going to get there by giving preferences and quotas. I
    supported that route for some time. And, again, I think it gets
    back to experience -- a little experience, a little age, a
    little intelligence. And I noted that nobody was really
    benefitting except a very small group at the top. The average
    person wasn't benefitting. People who had the money were
    benefitting. People who got all the jobs were benefitting.</p>
    <p>It seems to me that we ought to support the California civil
    rights initiative. It ought to be not based on gender or
    ethnicity or color -- or disability. I'm disabled, and I
    shouldn't have a preference. I would like to have one in this
    race, come to think of it, but I don't get one. Maybe we can
    work that out -- I get a 10-point spot. (Laughter.)</p>
    <p>This is America. No discrimination. Discrimination ought to
    be punished. But there ought to be equal opportunity. We ought
    to reach out and make certain everybody has a chance to
    participate. Equal opportunity, but we cannot guarantee equal
    results in America. That's not how America became the greatest
    country on the face of the Earth.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: I have never supported quotas. I have
    always been against them -- don't favor equal results. But I do
    favor making sure everybody has a chance to prove they're
    competent.</p>
    <p>The reason I have opposed that initiative is because I'm
    afraid it will end those extra effort programs. Again I say,
    think of the Americans With Disabilities Act. Make an effort to
    put a ramp up there so someone in a wheelchair can get up. You
    don't guarantee that they get the job; you guarantee they have
    a chance to prove their competence.</p>
    <p>And as I said, this is not a partisan thing with me. General
    Powell, Colin Powell said the same thing. He fears that the
    initiative will take away the extra effort program. No
    preferences to unqualified people, no quotas, but don't give up
    on making an extra effort until you're sure everybody has a
    chance to prove they're qualified.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: All right, the next question is for Senator Dole
    and it comes from this section right here. The back row there,
    in the blue shirt. Yes, sir?</p>
    <p>Q Senator Dole, how do you reduce taxes and balance the
    budget?</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Oh, I'm glad you asked. What's your first
    name? (Laughter.) I first want to say the President didn't
    quite give you all of the stuff on quotas, because the Justice
    Department entered what we call the Piscataway case up in New
    Jersey. It's pretty clear that was a quota case, and just
    because one teacher was white and one teacher was black and
    they had the same qualifications, they decided who would stay
    there. It shouldn't be that way.</p>
    <p>Now, the President can say, well, he wants to mend it, not
    end it. There are 168 federal programs that allow quotas, he
    ended one. Now, this economic package -- Tim, I'm glad you
    asked, because you look like the type that might be able to
    benefit from a 15-percent across-the-board tax cut and $500
    -per-child tax credit for state tax relief, which you're not
    interested in right now, but capital gains rate reduction. If
    you're taking care of an elderly parent, you get a $1,000
    deduction. We think that's very important because a lot of
    people take care of their parents.</p>
    <p>How do we pay for it? We're going to have a constitutional
    amendment to balance the budget, which the President opposed
    and defeated. He twisted arms, got six Democrats to vote with
    him, we lost by one vote. We're going to balance the budget by
    the year 2002.</p>
    <p>The President wants to spend 20 percent more over the next
    six years; I want to spend 14 percent more and give that six
    percent back to the people. Remember, it's your money. It's not
    his money and it's not my money. It's your money and you
    shouldn't have to apologize for wanting to keep all you can of
    it. He ought to apologize for wanting to take more and more. He
    wants to give you sort of a government tax cut which really
    doesn't mean anything.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: You know, one of the responsibilities of
    growing older, it seems to me, is being able to tell people
    something they may not want to hear just because it's true.
    When they had a $250-billion tax scheme -- that is half the
    size of this one, this one is $550 billion -- they passed a
    budget that had $270 billion in Medicare cuts, the first
    education cuts in history, cut environmental enforcement by 25
    percent, took away the guarantee of quality standards in
    nursing homes, took away the guarantee of health care to folks
    with disabilities.</p>
    <p>Don't take my word for this. The Economist Magazine told
    lots of economists -- seven Nobel Prize winners have said, if
    this tax scheme passes, it will require huge cuts, 40 percent
    in the environment, in law enforcement, in education, it will
    require bigger cuts in Medicare than I vetoed last time.</p>
    <p>My targeted tax cut gives tax cuts for education,
    child-rearing, buying a first-time home, paying for health care
    costs, and it's paid for. And I've told you how I'll pay for
    it; he won't tell you because he can't.</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Your targeted tax cut, Mr. President, never
    hits anybody. That's the problem with it, nobody ever gets it.
    But I must say, I'm a little offended by this word "scheme."
    You talked about it last time -- you talked about a risky
    scheme and then Vice President Gore repeated it about 10 times
    in St. Petersburg.</p>
    <p>If I have anything in politics, it's my word. My colleagues,
    Democrats and Republicans, will tell you that Bob Dole kept his
    word. I'm going to keep my word to you. I'm going to keep my
    word to the American -- we're going to cut taxes and balance
    the budget. We're not going to touch Medicare, it's going to
    grow 39 percent, and Social Security is going to grow 34
    percent.</p>
    <p>Now, the President doesn't have any ideas so he's now
    trashing ours. This isn't going to blow a hole in the deficit.
    He promised you a tax cut in 1992. And if you got one, you
    ought to vote for him.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: The next question is for the President. Yes sir,
    right there.</p>
    <p>Q I'm a martial arts instructor and a father. Mr. President,
    could you outline any plans you have to expand the Family Leave
    Act?</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: Thank you. Well, first let me say that I
    signed the Family Leave Act, it was my very first bill. And I'm
    very proud of it because it symbolizes what I think we ought to
    be doing. I don't take credit for all the good things that have
    happened in America, but I take credit for what I've tried to
    do to work with others to make good things happen.</p>
    <p>The most important good things that happen in America happen
    in families. Just about every family I know, their main concern
    is how am I going to succeed at work and still do right by my
    children. Family and Medical Leave has let 12 million families
    take a little time off for the birth of a child or a family
    illness without losing their job. I'd like to see it expanded
    in two ways.</p>
    <p>I'd like to say you can also take a little time off without
    losing your job to go to a regular parent-teacher conference or
    to go to a regular doctor's appointment with a family member.
    I'd also like to see the overtime laws change so that we could
    have some more flex time, so that at the discretion of the
    worker -- the worker -- if you earn overtime you could decide
    whether you want that time to be taken in cash or in time with
    your family, if you've got a family problem.</p>
    <p>I never go anywhere, it seems like, where I don't meet
    somebody who's benefitted from the Family Leave law. In
    Longview, Texas, the other day I met a woman who was almost in
    tears because she had been able to keep her job while spending
    time with her husband who had cancer. One of the people who's
    here with me today met a woman in the airport saying that her
    son just was able to be present at the birth of his child
    because of the Family Leave law.</p>
    <p>So, yes, I think it should be expanded. We have to help
    people succeed at home and at work.</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Well, 88 percent of the people the President
    claims, 11 million are already covered. And only five percent
    -- keep in mind, only five percent of the employers were even
    affected by the Family Leave Act.</p>
    <p>We had a better idea. We didn't win, but we had a better
    idea. Now that we have a majority we get a President -- that
    was a tax credit to the employer. Instead of the federal
    government reaching out, we had a tax credit. Pickups come with
    a cost because if you have to hire replacement workers, that's
    a cost.</p>
    <p>This is the way it ought to work: Give more power back to
    the states and back to the people, back to the taxpayers. Not
    always the long arm of the federal government.</p>
    <p>But keep in mind this bill covers 5 percent of the
    employers; 95 percent of the employers and those who employees
    they employ are not covered in this act. And according to
    Investors Daily, which I read just a couple of days ago, 88
    percent of the people he claims credit for were already covered
    in collective bargaining agreements or other agreements.</p>
    <p>We had family leave in our office. I see my friend Senator
    Mitchell -- he had family leave. I work every day with people.
    I've spent a lot of time in hospitals. I know what it's like to
    be in a hospital. Sure, we want family leave, but there is a
    better way to do it.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: I only have 30 seconds; I can't fix the
    statistics. It covers the majority of the work force. Employers
    of under 50 are exempted. The bill originally covered employers
    of 25 and more, but because of opposition we went up to 50.
    Senator Dole led the opposition to it. He filibustered it. He
    said it was a mistake. He said it would hurt the economy. We
    have had record numbers of new small businesses and 10.5
    million jobs. It didn't hurt the economy. He still believes
    it's a mistake. I believe it was right. You can decide which of
    us you think are right. It's up to you.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Next question for Senator Dole. Yes, ma'am.</p>
    <p>Q I'm a wife and mother of two sons, and my question for
    you, Senator Dole is, as the wife of a San Diego business
    owner, I see one of our biggest problems is the U.S. does not
    manufacture enough of our own products. How would you help this
    problem out?</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Well, right, we've lost 357,000 manufacturing
    jobs, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics said today that they
    made a mistake. It's probably going to be a much, much higher
    figure. So we're talking about all these new jobs -- we had
    better wait and see what the results are.</p>
    <p>We're going to do that with a more aggressive trade policy.
    We're going to do that with an economic package. We're going to
    do that with regulatory reform. You know, regulation costs the
    average family, right here, Democrat or Republican, about
    $7,000 a year -- $7,000 -- like a tax, put a lot of people out
    of business.</p>
    <p>I met a lady in Colorado Springs about seven weeks ago now.
    She had a small business with 63 employees. She finally gave it
    up. Why? Because of paperwork and regulations. Congress passed
    the Paperwork Reduction Act. The President exempted the IRS,
    which creates three-fourths of the paperwork.</p>
    <p>We're going to have regulatory -- we're going to have
    litigation reform. You know, I fell off a platform in
    California, in Chico, a while back. Before I hit the ground, my
    cell phone rang and this trial lawyer says, I think we've got a
    case here. (Laughter.) We've got to stop some of these
    frivolous lawsuits that are putting people out of business, men
    and women.</p>
    <p>Get the economy going. Cut the capital gains rate. Create
    more jobs and opportunities for everybody in America. That's
    what we will do. And my word is good. I keep my promises. I
    don't break my promises after the election, and I don't make
    new promises on an election year. We're going to get it done.
    We're going to grow some of these jobs in America, because we
    need to get -- they're going the wrong way.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: Let's look at the facts. We lost a lot of
    manufacturing jobs in the 12 years before I became President.
    We've gained manufacturing jobs since I've been President.
    We've negotiated over 200 separate trade agreements. Let's just
    take California. In California we made $37 billion worth of
    telecommunication equipment eligible for exports for the first
    time. We're selling everything from telephones to CDs to rice
    in Japan.</p>
    <p>We're selling American automobiles in Japan now. I visited a
    Chrysler dealership in Japan. We're number one in automobile
    manufacturing, production and sales around the world again for
    the first time since the 1970s. Why? Because we've had tough,
    aggressive trade policies and because we've got interest rates
    down and we had a good, stable economic policy; because we've
    reduced the deficit four years in a row for the first time in
    the 20th century that a President has done that in all four
    years.</p>
    <p>And that's why I don't want to see it blow a big hole in the
    deficit with a tax program we can't pay for, so your interest
    rates will go up and you'll have to pay back in higher interest
    rates what you allegedly will get in a tax cut.</p>
    <p>So I say keep working on expanding the market. More than
    half of these 10.5 million new jobs are in higher wage areas.
    And we'll have more manufacturing and more sales at home and
    around the world.</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Well, you may think the biggest employer in
    America is General Motors, but I've got news for you -- it's
    Manpower Services, hiring people temporarily who have lost
    their jobs and they go to work for 30 days or 60 days. That's a
    good economy? I don't think so. We're setting new records this
    year.</p>
    <p>We have the worst economy in a century. We've had the
    slowest growth, about 2.5 percent. The President inherited a
    growth of over 5 percent. We don't have the S&amp;L crisis
    anymore. Republicans have cut $53 billion in spending. That's
    why the budget looked good. It didn't look too good the first
    two years when we had a Democratic President and a Democratic
    Congress.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: The next question is for President Clinton. Yes,
    sir.</p>
    <p>Q I'm a travel agent. And can you please explain your policy
    on the Employment Nondiscrimination Act that would have
    prohibited discrimination, would have prohibited people from
    being fired from their jobs simply for being gay or
    lesbian?</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: I'm for it. That's my policy. I'm for it.
    I believe that any law-abiding, tax-paying citizen who shows up
    in the morning and doesn't break the law and doesn't interfere
    with his or her neighbors ought to have the ability to work in
    our country and shouldn't be subject to unfair discrimination.
    I'm for it.</p>
    <p>I have a little time left, so let me just say that I get
    attacked so many times on these questions it's hard to answer
    all those things. In February -- Senator Dole just said we had
    the worst economy in a century. In February he said we had the
    best economy in 30 years. In February. And I don't want to
    respond in kind to all of these things. I could. I could answer
    a lot of these things tit for tat, but I hope we can talk about
    what we're going to do in the future. No attack ever created a
    job or educated a job or helped a family make ends meet. No
    insults ever cleaned up a toxic waste dump or helped an elderly
    person.</p>
    <p>Now, for four years, that's what I've worked on. If you will
    give me four years more, I'll work on it some more. And I'll
    try to answer these charges, but I would prefer to emphasize
    direct answers for the future and I gave you a direct
    answer.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Senator Dole?</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Well, I'm opposed to discrimination in any
    form, but I don't favor creating special rights for any group.
    That would be my answer to this question. And I'm -- it would
    be special rights for different groups in America. But I'm
    totally opposed to discrimination. Don't have any policy
    against hiring anyone for his lifestyle or whatever -- we don't
    have any policy of that kind, never have had in my office or
    will we have in the future.</p>
    <p>But as far as special rights, I'm opposed to same-sex
    marriages, which the President signed well after midnight one
    morning, in the dark of night, he opposed it. But I'll get back
    to the economic package, because, again, I think this is very
    important.</p>
    <p>If there's anything that's going to change America, it's to
    get the economy to grow. The President inherited a good economy
    -- sure. The S&amp;L crisis ended, we're selling assets, we've
    got a Republican Congress cutting spending finally, and he says
    he had the best four years ever.</p>
    <p>That's not true. We had over 1.2 million bankruptcies -- set
    a new record. Credit card debts never been higher. I just told
    you about this manufacturing job loss which is going to
    increase. We need a good, strong economic package, but the
    private sector creates the jobs and they can do it.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: If you believe that the California
    economy was better in 1992 than it is today, you should vote
    for Bob Dole.</p>
    <p>I have worked so hard out here to help turn this economy
    around. Let me just give you one tiny example. In San Diego,
    where we had some defense cutbacks, we funded a project with
    the University of California at San Diego to use airplane
    composite materials to build lighter, stronger bridges -- a
    little project and a program that Senator Dole opposed. And
    that composite now is going to be built around the bridges on
    the Santa Monica Freeway to help minimize the impact of
    earthquakes and create more jobs. That's just one tiny example.
    Maybe we'll talk about some more before it's over.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Next question is for Senator Dole. Yes,
    ma'am.</p>
    <p>Q Senator Dole, I work in health care, and it's truly an
    honor to be here tonight to address both of you. Being in
    health care -- we have talked a little bit about health care
    tonight, but mainly Medicaid and Medicare have been mentioned.
    But the private sector is a problem.</p>
    <p>Managed care is taking over, especially in California. And
    because of that, the quality of care is going downhill. There
    are many, many people who cannot get the tests that they need
    when they need them. And because of that, they are dying
    needlessly. There are many, many more lawsuits being presented
    against the managed care industry because of this. And I think
    it's a real problem that needs to be addressed. What would you
    do if you were President?</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Well, one thing I did was to oppose the
    government takeover of health care that President Clinton
    offered in 1993, which created 17 new taxes and 50 new
    bureaucracies and price controls. Because we were afraid the
    very thing you mentioned would have happened -- everybody would
    have been forced into managed care. You couldn't have chosen
    your own doctor, and that would have been the end.</p>
    <p>And I think right now we've got to go back -- I know they've
    appointed a commission to take a look at managed care. Maybe
    that's part of the answer. But it seems to me, if we start
    taking choices away from people and if we drive them into one
    type care, if we eliminate fee-for-service altogether, or
    eliminate the fact that you can go to your doctor, you've got
    to go somewhere else, then I think we've taken a giant step
    backward in the United States of America.</p>
    <p>We have the best health care delivery system in the world,
    and we want to keep it that way. That's why we opposed the
    government takeover health care plan that President Clinton
    tried and tried and tried to get through Congress. He didn't
    get it done. When it ended up we had more votes than he had,
    then they decided to pull the plug. It was a big, big mistake.
    Now, whether or not he'll do that again -- I've heard some of
    the people say, well, that's the model we ought to use, and if
    he's reelected maybe he'll come back and try it again. I hope
    not. I hope not in both cases.</p>
    <p>But it does seem to me that you've raised a very important
    point that needs to be addressed. You're going to have to watch
    it, going to have to take a look at all the managed care going
    on in California, or we're going to end up losing our -- best
    care that we have in the world.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: I'm just curious, how many of you are
    under managed care plan? Raise your hand if you're in a managed
    care plan.</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: -- young people here.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: How many of you like it? Well --</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Two.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: One of the things that I tried to do was
    to make sure that everybody in the country who was under a
    managed care plan should at least have three choices of plan
    and would have the right to get out without penalty every year.
    That's not a government takeover. That's like the Family and
    Medical Leave law -- it just tries to set the rules of the
    game.</p>
    <p>I'm strongly in favor of a federal bill to repeal any gag
    rules on providers. In other words, I believe that doctors
    should not be able to be kicked out of managed care plans just
    because they tell the patient what they need and what more
    expensive care options might be. If we're saving money and
    managing resources better, that's a good thing. If we're saving
    money and depriving people of care, that's a bad thing. A good
    place to start is to say, no managed care provider can gag a
    doctor and kick the doctor out of the managed care plan for the
    doctor telling a patient you need a more expensive test, you
    need a more expensive procedure, your health requires it.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Senator Dole?</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Well, I don't have any quarrel with that; I
    think that would help. But I think what we want to avoid is
    falling back into this nationalized health care system that
    President Clinton wanted to give us in 1993. If that isn't a
    liberal idea, I've never heard one: 17 new taxes, price
    controls, 50 new bureaucracies. We've have that trouble all
    over America. We need to deal with managed care. It not only
    has happened in California, it's happening in other states that
    we visit, too. It's a national problem, not just a state
    problem.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: The next question is for President Clinton in
    this section. Yes, ma'am?</p>
    <p>Q I teach history and political science at San Diego Mesa
    College, right up the road here. I'd like to tee off from the
    original question by another teacher and speak for those people
    that aren't here tonight -- 63 percent of the American people
    are not participating that are eligible to vote, not even
    participating in the process. Several parties can't even get
    into the debates. The Green Party, the Reform Party, the
    Natural Law Party -- all of these people have basically opted
    out of what we're still participating in. And if we, in fact,
    are going to bring the country back together and be all faces
    around the table -- the new American family -- what do you see
    as something the president can do to bring that process to
    bring them back in?</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: First of all, I think it's important to
    make voting more accessible. That's why I strongly supported
    the Motor Voter law. There was a big story I think in USA Today
    about the millions of people who have now registered because of
    it.</p>
    <p>Secondly, I think we need to look at making the elections
    more accessible. You know, several states now are letting
    people vote over three weeks. A lot of people are busy and it's
    hard for them to just get there and vote.</p>
    <p>The third thing I think we need is more forums like this,
    which is one of the reasons why I have so strongly supported
    campaign finance reform, because if you want to cut the costs
    of campaigns, you have to open the air waves, because what
    drives the costs of campaigns are the costs of advertising on
    television, radio, newspaper, mass mailings.</p>
    <p>And if you open the air waves to more things like this --
    you see, it's not just you that are participating here. For
    every one of you who stood up here and asked a question
    tonight, I promise you, there's 100,000 Americans who say I
    wish I could have asked that question. So I think we have to
    change the nature of politics.</p>
    <p>The last thing I think we should do is something I've been
    trying do to since I've been President, is, every time I do
    something in a public way, I try to have a real American
    citizen there who is directly affected by it so that people can
    see the connection of what happens way across the country in
    Washington with more police on the street in San Diego, clean
    up the sewage here in San Diego, doubling the border guards
    here in southern California, that there is a connection between
    what we do way back there and what we do here. Those are my
    best ideas about it.</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: I don't know of any perfect solution. I've
    been in politics for some time and I worry about people who
    don't vote, and I wonder if it's our fault, the candidates'
    fault. People say I don't care, one vote doesn't make a
    difference. I can give you hundreds of cases -- you can
    probably give me 200 cases where one vote made a difference. I
    know it made a lot of difference many times in the
    Congress.</p>
    <p>Campaign finance might help, might help contributions coming
    in from Indonesia or other foreign countries, rich people from
    those countries, and then being sent back after the L.A. Times
    discovers it -- $250,000. But maybe there ought to be more
    debates. I'd be willing to have another debate this year, where
    we can invite all the candidates and talk about the economy. If
    we don't get the economy to grow, if we don't cut taxes and
    give people child credit and cut the capital gains rate and get
    this economy growing, we're going to limp into the next
    century. If we grow the economy, it's going to help Social
    Security, going to help jobs, going to help everything.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: Let me make one other suggestion. Because
    you're a teacher, you can have an impact on that. One of the
    things I think that really frustrates people is that so often
    political campaigns seem to be more about the politicians that
    are running than the people. Now, there is a connection. I
    think what we have to do is convince the people there is a big
    difference. If you vote one way, you will have a Department of
    Education in the 21st century. If you vote the other way, you
    won't. If you vote one way, you'll have an expansion of family
    leave. If you vote the other way, you'll be lucky to save
    it.</p>
    <p>But these are important questions, and people have to
    decide. I think that the American people also need to be a
    little more responsible and think about whether there is a
    connection between their lives and what we do in
    Washington.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: For Senator Dole, in this section. The back row.
    Yes, ma'am.</p>
    <p>Q I'm unemployed. Senator Dole, we talked about Social
    Security for the baby boomers, but shouldn't we be saving and
    investing for our own retirement as well? Are you planning any
    incentives to encourage us to take care of ourselves rather
    than to rely on the government and on Social Security when we
    retire?</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Well, we have in our economic package
    Individual Retirement Accounts we think will encourage savings.
    You could also use those accounts for health care or education
    or a first home. We're doing that precisely. And I think one
    thing sooner or later we're going to have to consider is to
    take a look at the Social Security system. Because we've got a
    lot of people advocating that, well, we don't want to put our
    money into Social Security. Now, you've got to be very careful
    about that. You have to protect the people that are already in
    the pipeline.</p>
    <p>That's something you might consider. I'm not suggesting it
    will be done, but at least we ought to look at it. When I was
    chairman of the Finance Committee, which handles Social
    Security, we looked at all these options. And one thing we've
    got to make certain -- when I used to go home my mother would
    tell me, all I've got is my Social Security, don't touch it.
    And we didn't touch it. We preserved it.</p>
    <p>And I'm an optimist. Your Social Security is going to be
    there when you retire. We'll fix it. It will probably happen in
    the year 2012 or 2015. In 1983 we thought we had a 75-year fix.
    It didn't work. It's much, much less; but at least we fixed it
    for some time and 37 million to 40 million people get their
    checks on time.</p>
    <p>But we need to preserve the system. And we need to make it
    stronger. But we also need to look at some options, whether or
    not we -- it depends on what the options are. In fact, I've got
    a commission right now in Congress, a bipartisan commission,
    looking at all the different options they're going to present
    for the next Congress. So I think we'll wait and see what they
    present and take a look at it.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: This is one where we have some agreement,
    I think. Only about half the people in this country have
    pension plans. And Social Security is not enough for a lot of
    people to live on, or at least it's not enough for them to
    maintain anything like their previous lifestyle. We've got to
    figure out how we're going to have more people with pension
    plans. And pension coverage has been declining as more and more
    people work for small businesses and fewer people work for big
    businesses.</p>
    <p>So what is in my plan -- and I think it's almost identical
    to what's in Senator Dole's plan -- is we make more people that
    are now eligible to save in an IRA and we let couples, married
    couples, save more. And then they could withdraw from it
    tax-free if they needed to for medical emergencies or to buy a
    home or for an education. But they could also save to
    supplement their retirement.</p>
    <p>In addition to that, we just passed a sweeping small
    business reform that makes it easier for small business people
    to take out 401(k) plans for themselves and their employees;
    and then much easier for employees to carry it from job to job.
    My best friend from grade school is a computer software
    salesman. And he told me the last time he changed employers it
    took him nine months to figure out how to transfer his 401(k)
    plan. Now none of that will happen anymore.</p>
    <p>And so I hope that over the next 10 years you'll see a big
    increase in the percentage of people that have pension plans
    plus a secure Social Security system.</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Did you say you're unemployed? The first thing
    I'd do is get you a job. (Laughter.) And that's the economic
    package, again -- create jobs and opportunity; reduce the
    capital gains rate; reduce regulatory reform; stop some of the
    senseless litigation and let people work in America. And I
    think that's the thrust we will make.</p>
    <p>Obviously, Social Security is a very important program. It
    will be preserved -- Democrats or Republicans -- it will be
    preserved. We want to make certain we protect those in the
    pipeline, just as we did back in 1983. And we did it on a
    bipartisan basis. We took it out of politics. People get so
    tired of politics. We ought to do the same with Medicare. Maybe
    we could make a deal here tonight.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: All right, the question is for President
    Clinton. Does anybody have a foreign affairs question in this
    section? Yes, sir.</p>
    <p>Q Good evening. I'm an electronics technician in the Navy.
    My question was how you plan to deal with the trade deficit
    with Japan?</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: Let me tell you what we have done. We
    have concluded with Japan 21, about to be 22 trade agreements
    now. And since we did that, in the areas where we concluded
    trade agreements, our exports to Japan have gone up by 85
    percent in the last four years. And our trade deficit with
    Japan has gone down.</p>
    <p>Until about five months ago, the Japanese economy was in a
    deep recession. It's coming back now. So they can buy even more
    American products, and I think it will go down more.</p>
    <p>But I'm very -- that's one of the real success stories here
    of the work we've done. We're selling Japanese rice from
    California for the first time. I visited a Chrysler dealership
    in Tokyo. I visited a Jeep plant, the oldest auto plant in
    America in Toledo, Ohio, where they're going to export 41,000
    righthand-drive Jeeps this year. And they've got 700 new jobs
    because of it.</p>
    <p>There is no easy way to do this. When you're dealing with an
    economy that's traditionally been more closed and one that's
    traditionally been more open, you just have to gut it out issue
    by issue by issue. We've agreed in principle on an insurance
    agreement and we're working on three or four other areas
    now.</p>
    <p>But the way to do it is to make sure you're competitive --
    we're the most competitive country in the world now -- and then
    just fight to open those markets and go try to make a sale. And
    that's what our Trade Ambassador, our Commerce Secretary, all
    the other people in our administration have tried to do.</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Well, the bottom line is, we've got to stop
    exporting jobs. We need to keep jobs here. I said there's
    357,000 good jobs, manufacturing jobs which are lost. And I
    assume some of those because of our trading partners, we didn't
    have access to their markets.</p>
    <p>We ought to insist on access. If we don't have access to
    their markets, the same way they have access to our markets
    then we ought to say, wait a minute, that's enough, time out.
    When you give us access, we'll give you access. It's very hard
    to get into the Japanese market, as everybody knows.</p>
    <p>If they want to get into our markets, they sell a lot of
    automobiles here, create a lot of jobs, those who sell exports,
    and it's very important to the economy. But I think we want to
    make certain.</p>
    <p>I supported the President's trade policies, but we've got to
    be more aggressive. Once you have a policy, then you've got to
    go out and be aggressive and enforce that policy. There are
    American jobs that are being lost. That's what Ross Perot
    complains about. And I'd say to the Reform Party, take a look
    at the Republican Party. We're the reform party and we're going
    to make things better, and one of the things we're going to do
    is stop exporting jobs in America.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: Let me say again: We've had over 200
    separate trade agreements in the last four years. By far, the
    largest number in American history -- not just the big ones
    you've read about, but a lot of smaller ones.</p>
    <p>Now, what we have to do is to focus on those things that
    we're real good at and make sure we're getting a fair deal. We
    just had a pretty serious dispute with China because they were
    copying our CDs and costing thousands of jobs in places like
    California. So we had -- we said, you know, if you want to keep
    doing business and selling your products over here, you're
    going to have to quit pirating our CDs. And they agreed to do a
    number of things and to let us verify that they've done it, but
    I think they're going to make the problem much better.</p>
    <p>But there is not a simple, easy answer; you just have to
    work on this day in and day out, every month, every year, every
    issue to make sure that we have not only free trade but fair
    trade. I'm proud that we're better off on that than we were
    four years ago.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: All right, the next question is for Senator
    Dole.</p>
    <p>Q This great nation has been established by the founding
    fathers, who possessed a very strong Christian belief in Godly
    principles. If elected President of the United States, what
    could you do to return this nation to these basic principles;
    and, also, do you feel that the office of the President has
    responsibility to set the role -- to inspire our young
    people?</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Well, no doubt about it, our founding fathers
    had a great deal of wisdom. In addition to what you mentioned,
    they also were concerned about this all-powerful central
    government in Washington, D.C. that would, in effect,
    confiscate your property.</p>
    <p>So I carry around in my pocket -- I can't pull it out, I'd
    violate the rules -- a copy of the 10th Amendment, which says
    that we ought to return power to the states and power to the
    people, the people here. You ought to make more decisions.
    Honor, duty and country. That's what America is all about.</p>
    <p>Certainly, the President of the United States, in the
    highest office in the world, the most important office in the
    world has the responsibility to young people -- we talked about
    earlier -- to everyone by example. And when it comes to public
    ethics, he has a responsibility.</p>
    <p>When you have thirty-some in your administration who have
    either left or are being investigated or in jail or whatever,
    then you've got an ethical problem. It's public ethics. I'm not
    talking about private. We're talking about public ethics. When
    you have 900 files gathered up by some guy who was a bouncer in
    a bar and hired as a security officer to collect files. In
    Watergate, I know a person who went to jail for looking at one
    file, on FBI file. They're are 900 sequestered in the White
    House -- 900. People like you. Why should they be rifling
    through your files?</p>
    <p>So the President has a great responsibility and it's one
    that I understand and would certainly carry out.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: This is the most religious, great country
    in history. And, yet, interestingly enough, we have the most
    religious freedom of any country in the world, including the
    freedom not to believe. And now we have all these people, just
    up the road in Los Angeles County we've got people from 150
    different racial and ethnic groups and they've got tons of
    different religions.</p>
    <p>But the fundamental tenets of virtually every religion are
    the same. And what I tried to do is to support policies that
    would respect religion and then help parents inculcate those
    values for their children. And let me very briefly give you
    some examples.</p>
    <p>One of my proudest moments was signing the Religious Freedom
    Restoration Act, which says the government has got to bend over
    backwards before we interfere with religious practices. So I
    changed the Justice Department effort to get a church to pay
    back a man's tithe because he was bankrupt when he gave it. I
    supported character education programs in our schools,
    drug-free schools programs. I supported giving parents a V-chip
    on their television so if they don't want their young kids to
    watch things they shouldn't watch, they wouldn't have to.</p>
    <p>That's the kind of thing we need to do. Give people like you
    and our families the power to give those values to our
    children.</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Well, I think it's -- you know, before I came
    in tonight my wife and daughter and I had a prayer because it's
    God will; whatever happens, God's will, it will happen. A
    constitutional amendment for voluntary prayer in school, in my
    view, would be a great idea. I support it; the President
    opposes it.</p>
    <p>And it seems to me the President, whoever the President may
    be, this is one of his highest responsibilities. People look to
    the President of the United States more than any other person
    in America, and that's the way it's always been, and that's the
    way it always will be.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: All right. This is our last question. It goes to
    President Clinton and it's from this section. Yes, ma'am.</p>
    <p>Q I, too, am a minister. I am with Universal Fellowship of
    Metropolitan Community Churches. President Clinton, perhaps you
    can help me with something tonight. I've heard Mr. Dole say
    several times, "all of us together." And when he was asked if
    he would support equal rights in employment for gay and lesbian
    people, you said that you favored that. And he said that he did
    not believe in special rights. And I thought the question was,
    equal rights for all people. And I don't understand why people
    are using the term "special rights" when the question is equal
    rights.</p>
    <p>Could you help me in understanding that?</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: I want to answer your question, but let
    me say one other thing. We don't need a constitutional
    amendment for kids to pray. And what I did was to have the
    Justice Department and the Education Department, for the first
    time ever, issue a set of guidelines that we gave to every
    school in America, saying that children could not be interfered
    with in religious advocacy when they were praying, when they
    were doing whatever they could do under the constitution, just
    because they were on a public school ground.</p>
    <p>And I think anyone who has experienced this would tell you
    that our administration has done more than any in 30 years to
    clarify the freedom of religion in the public square, including
    in the public schools.</p>
    <p>Now, I think I have to let Senator Dole speak for himself.
    It wouldn't be fair for me to do that. I would wind up -- I
    mean, it's the last question. I'd mischaracterize it to try to
    make you happy. (Laughter.) Let me tell you what I feel. We
    have a lot of differences in our country, and some of us
    believe that other people's decisions are wrong, even in
    morals. But under our Constitution, if you show up tomorrow and
    obey the law and you work hard and you do what you're supposed
    to do, you're entitled to equal treatment. That's the way the
    system works.</p>
    <p>All over the world people are being torn apart -- in Bosnia,
    the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Burundi, you name
    it, because of all of their differences. We still have some of
    that hatred inside us. You see it in the church-burnings. And
    one of the things I've tried hardest to do is to tell the
    American people that we have to get beyond that, we have to
    understand that we're stronger when we unite around shared
    values instead of being divided by our differences.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Senator Dole.</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Well, I hope I've made my answer clear, that
    I'm opposed to discrimination. We've suffered discrimination in
    the disability community. There are 43 million of us, and I can
    recall cases where people would cross the street rather than to
    meet somebody in a wheelchair. So we want to end
    discrimination. I think that answers itself. No discrimination
    in America. We've made that clear.</p>
    <p>And I would just say that it seems to me that that's the way
    it ought to be. We shouldn't discriminate -- race, color,
    whatever -- lifestyle, disability. This is America, and we're
    all proud of it, but we're not there yet. But we need a good,
    strong leadership going into the next century. I'm sorry we
    didn't have a foreign policy question because just this week,
    Secretary Christopher said, well, we didn't know much the first
    couple of years about foreign policy. Now, that was quite an
    admission. It underscores what I had to say in the Hartford
    debate, that there is really no foreign policy in this
    administration; it's sort of ad hoc, it's whatever comes up,
    we'll deal with it. Unfortunately, we didn't have more
    questions on that.</p>
    <p>THE PRESIDENT: Let me say again, there is no more important
    responsibility for the President than to say if you believe in
    the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of
    Independence, that's all we need to know and you can be part of
    our America and you can walk across that bridge to the 21st
    century with us.</p>
    <p>And we are not well-served when we attack each other in a
    kind of an ad hominem way. It doesn't create jobs. It doesn't
    educate children. It doesn't solve problems. We need to be
    disagreeing on ideas honestly and talking about the future. The
    future will be the greatest time in this country's history if
    we can beat this division that is bedeviling the whole rest of
    the world.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: All right, now we go to the closing statements.
    Senator Dole, you're first. Two minutes, sir.</p>
    <p>SENATOR DOLE: Well, let me thank everybody here at the
    University; and Jim, thank you; all the people who may still be
    watching or viewing. This is what it's all about. It's not
    about me. It's not about President Clinton. It's about the
    process. It's about selecting a President of the United
    States.</p>
    <p>So we have our differences. We should have our differences.
    You mentioned other parties, they have their differences. If we
    all agreed, it would be a pretty dull place. We should have
    more debates. I think we'll have another debate on the
    economy.</p>
    <p>But I would just say this: This is the highest honor that
    I've ever had in my life, to think that somebody from Russell,
    Kansas, somebody who grew up in a basement apartment, somebody
    whose parents didn't finish high schools, somebody who spent
    about 39 months in hospitals after World War II, somebody who
    uses a button hook every day to get dressed, somebody who
    understands the real Americans out there with real problems --
    whether soccer moms or the single parents or families or
    seniors or people with disabilities, whoever it may be.</p>
    <p>But there are some very fundamental differences in this
    campaign. President Clinton opposes term limits. President
    Clinton opposes a constitutional amendment to balance the
    budget. President Clinton opposes a voluntary prayer amendment.
    He opposes an amendment to protect the flag of the United
    States of America. People give their lives -- a couple of
    servicemen here, they sacrifice. They give everything for
    America. We ought to protect the American flag with a
    constitutional amendment.</p>
    <p>But beyond that, we need to address the economy. And I would
    just say, with my time running out here, it's a very proud
    moment for me. And what I want the voters to do is to make a
    decision. And I want them to be proud of their vote in the
    years ahead, proud that they voted for the right candidate,
    proud that they voted, hopefully, for me.</p>
    <p>And I'll just make you one promise: My word is good.
    Democrats and Republicans said Bob Dole's word is good. I keep
    my word. I promise you the economy is going to get better,
    we're going to have a good economic package, and we're going
    into the next century a better America.</p>
    <p>Thank you.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON: Thank you, Jim, and thank you, ladies and
    gentlemen, and all the people who are watching.</p>
    <p>One thing I'd like to say is I agree with what Senator Dole
    said, it's a remarkable thing in a country like ours that a man
    who grew up in Russell, Kansas, and one who was born to a
    widowed mother in Hope, Arkansas, could wind up running for
    President, could have a chance to serve as President.</p>
    <p>The first thing I want to say is, thank you for giving me
    the chance to be President.</p>
    <p>This election is about two different visions about how we
    should go into the 21st century. Would we be better off, as I
    believe, working together to give each other the tools we need
    to make the most of our God-given potential? Or are we better
    off saying, you're on your own? Would we better off building
    that bridge to the future together, so we can all walk across
    it, or saying, you can get across yourself?</p>
    <p>If you don't leave this room with anything else tonight, and
    if the people watching us don't leave with anything else, I
    hope you will leave with this: This is a real important
    election. The world is changing dramatically in how we work and
    how we live, how we relate to each other -- huge changes. And
    the decisions we make will have enormous practical
    consequences.</p>
    <p>So we've talked about our responsibility tonight. I want to
    talk about your responsibility and your responsibility. Your
    responsibility is to show up on November 5th, because you're
    going to decide whether we're going to balance the budget now,
    but protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.
    You will decide whether we're going to keep fighting crime with
    the Brady Bill, the assault weapons and finish putting those
    100,000 police; whether we're going to move a million people
    from welfare to work; whether we're going to give our families
    more protection for their kids against drugs and tobacco and
    gangs and guns; whether we're going to give our children
    world-class education where every 8-year-old can read, every
    12-year-old can log in on the Internet, every 18-year-old can
    go to college.</p>
    <p>If we do those things, we'll build that bridge to the 21st
    century, and the greatest country in history will be even
    greater. Thank you.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Mr. President.
    This concludes -- this is the last of the three 1996
    Presidential and Vice Presidential debates. (Applause.)<br>
