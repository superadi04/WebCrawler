    PRESS RELEASE<br>

      <tt><b>TRANSCRIPT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON�S FREE AIR TIME
      REMARKS</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt><i>President Clinton�s remarks will be broadcast this
    evening, October 24, 1996, on the following stations: CNN,
    C-SPAN, NOSTALGIA TELEVISION, NPR, PBS AND UPN.</i></tt></p>
    <p><tt>Throughout this election, I have done my best to focus
    on ideas, not insults.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>I have done that because what really matters are the
    lives and futures of the American people -- and who can best
    lead us into the 21st century.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>I have a philosophy I�ve tried hard to follow these last
    four years -- create opportunity for all; reinforce
    responsibility from all; and help us to build a community where
    all Americans have a role to play.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Compared to four years ago, we�re clearly on the right
    track: 10 1/2 million new jobs; a 60% cut in the deficit;
    incomes rising for the first time in a decade; nearly 2 million
    fewer people on welfare; the lowest crime rate in ten years.
    We�re putting 100,000 police on our streets, and we�ve stopped
    60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers from buying
    guns.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Our progress is only the beginning. Now let�s keep
    going, and build our bridge to the 21st century by focussing on
    what really matters in the lives of our people.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>What matters is how we strengthen our families. Strong
    families need first a strong economy. That means balancing our
    budget to lower interest rates on everything from home
    mortgages to car loans to credit card payments and student
    loans, but doing so while protecting Medicare, Medicaid,
    education, and the environment. It means giving tax cuts to
    help families when they need it the most -- to raise and
    educate their children, to pay for medical emergencies, and buy
    that first home. It means working hard to help parents protect
    our children from gangs and guns, from drugs and
    tobacco.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>What really matters is how we finish the job of
    reforming welfare, so we can break the cycle of dependency for
    those families who are trapped in it. We must move at least one
    million people from welfare to work; and I�ve got a plan to do
    that in partnership with the private sector.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>What matters, more than anything else now, is how we
    give our children the best education in the world, to prepare
    them for that 21st century. We must make sure that every
    eight-year-old can read; every twelve-year-old can log onto the
    Internet; and every eighteen-year-old can go on to college; and
    every worker can keep on learning for a lifetime.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Now if we focus on these things, on what really matters
    for our future, we will build that bridge to the 21st century,
    with more opportunity, more responsibility, and a stronger
    community for all of us.</tt></p>
