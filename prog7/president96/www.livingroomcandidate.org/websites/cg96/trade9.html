              South Carolina is the country�s 34th largest
              agricultural exporting state, shipping $219 million
              in agricultural exports abroad in 1994 (latest year
              available for Department of Agriculture state export
              data). The largest export category, tobacco,
              accounted for nearly 45 percent of South Carolina�s
              agricultural exports in 1994. Given the 22 percent
              increase in total U.S. agriculture exports in 1995,
              agriculture exports from South Carolina in 1995 will
              likely range between $250 million and $275 million.
