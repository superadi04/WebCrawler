<BR>PRESS RELEASE
<BR>October 5, 1996						

<P><B><CENTER>MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS PRESENT ENDORSEMENT OF
 <BR>PRESIDENT CLINTON AND VICE PRESIDENT GORE,
 <BR>PRESS ACTIVITIES IN 34 STATES MARK THE ENDORSEMENT</CENTER></B>


<P>Three major environmental groups -- the Sierra Club, Clean Water Action and the League of Conservation Voters -- today presented their endorsements of President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.  Vice President Gore accepted the endorsements from the three groups, who represent over one million Americans, at an event in Washington, D.C.

	<P>Said Vice President Gore upon accepting the endorsement, “President Clinton and I are committed to protecting our families’ future.  No child should have to drink water contaminated by dangerous chemicals, eat food laden with pesticides or live near a toxic waste dump. We will not let Bob Dole, Newt Gingrich and extreme anti-environmentalists in Congress destroy 25 years of progress on safe water, clean air or toxic waste standards.  We will not compromise America’s natural heritage in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, Tongass National Forest, the Mojave National Preserve and other areas.”

	<P>In announcing the endorsements, leaders of the three groups praised President Clinton’s leadership on a broad range of environmental issues and condemned Bob Dole’s 35-year record of votes against the environment. Deb Callahan, President of the bipartisan League of Conservation Voters (LCV), contrasted the Clinton Administration’s record in support of environmental protection with Bob Dole’s congressional record of anti-environmental votes, as scored by the annual LCV National Environmental Scorecard.  “With only a 19 percent lifetime voting record, Bob Dole has voted against the environment four out of five times over the last 25 years.  You have to work very hard to acquire such a terrible record,” Callahan said.

	<P>Speaking for the 700,000 members of Clean Water Action, Board Member Myrth York stated,  “President Clinton’s vetoes were the only thing standing between the Dole/Gingrich, pro-polluter Congress and its desire to gut the Clean Water Act and other protections for our health and the environment.”

	<P>Sierra Club President Adam Werbach added, “President Clinton and Vice President Gore have demonstrated a strong commitment to protecting America’s environment for our families and our future.  Their leadership in protecting the environment has earned them the support of the Sierra Club and all Americans.”  
	 
	<P>Clinton/Gore Campaign Manager Peter S. Knight said, “The endorsements of these major environmental groups is a strong acknowledgment of the President’s and Vice President’s commitment to the environment.  We are thrilled to have the support of these prestigious groups.”
	
	<P>Companion press activities featuring environmental leaders, citizen activists and Clinton/Gore campaign officials are being held in 34 states across the nation marking the endorsement.  (See attached list.)
