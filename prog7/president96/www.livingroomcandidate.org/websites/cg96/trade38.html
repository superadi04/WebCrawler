              Connecticut is the country�s 42nd largest
              agricultural exporting state, shipping $42.5 million
              in agricultural exports abroad in 1994 (latest year
              available for Department of Agriculture state export
              data). Given the 22 percent increase in total U.S.
              agriculture exports in 1995, agriculture exports from
              Connecticut in 1995 will likely range between $47
