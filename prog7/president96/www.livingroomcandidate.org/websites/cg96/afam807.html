    <p><tt>PRESS RELEASE<br>
    August 7, 1996</tt></p>
    <p><tt>CLINTON/GORE '96 OPENS AFRICAN-AMERICAN OUTREACH
    OFFICE</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The Clinton/Gore �96 campaign headquarters announced the
    opening of its office of African American Outreach. Located in
    Washington, D.C., the office is charged with raising the level
    of political participation by African Americans and increasing
    voter turnout of African Americans.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"The office of African American outreach is a vital
    component of the Clinton/Gore �96 campaign and will be
    instrumental in ensuring the success of President Clinton and
    Vice President Gore in the fall," noted Alan Wheat, Deputy
    Campaign Manager and Director of Public Liaison for the
    campaign, adding "the President has pledged his continued
    support and commitment to policies and initiatives that will
    have the greatest positive impact on the African American
    community"�</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Harold J. Gist will serve as the Assistant Director of
    Public Liaison and Director of African American Outreach. Gist,
    an Arkansas native, served as the Deputy Director of the
    Community Services Division with the Democratic National
    Committee in Washington, D.C. Gist will be responsible for
    identifying and mobilizing state leadership, as well as forming
    coalitions with African American organizations and allied
    groups to maximize support for President Clinton.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Since taking office, President Clinton has amassed an
    impressive record on issues of concern to African Americans.
    Under President Clinton�s leadership, the administration has
    provided incentives to create over 100,000 new African American
    businesses, with new tax cuts made available to 90 percent of
    all small businesses. President Clinton appointed the most
    diverse Cabinet and Administration in history, including four
    African American Cabinet-level officials. Fourteen percent of
    all Administration appointees are African American; more
    African Americans (45) serve in the White House now than at any
    time in history; and he nominated thirty-six African Americans
    to the federal bench. In addition, President Clinton has
    created nine Economic Empowerment Zones and ninety-five
    Enterprise Communities.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Also joining the office are Sandi Jackson and Mona Mohib
    as National Outreach Coordinator and Special Assistant,
    respectively. Jackson, a native of Chicago, is a lawyer and
    served as Press Secretary to the late Congressman Mickey
    Leland. Mohib, a Connecticut native, served as a Management
    Consultant and Government Relations Assistant for Metropolitan
    Life Insurance Company.</tt></p>
