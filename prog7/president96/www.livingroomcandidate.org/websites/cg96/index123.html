          <p><b>Women's Outreach Events</b></p>
          <p><a href="../../../external.html"><b>September 24 -
          Family and Medical Leave</b></a> September 24 was the
          anniversary of Bob Dole's vote to uphold President Bush's
          veto of the Family and Medical Leave Act â€” signed into
          law by President Clinton. 44 different Action Events on
          this day celebrated the success of Family and Medical
          Leave.</p>
          <p><a href="../../../external.html"><b>October - Domestic
          Violence Month</b></a> The first federal effort at
          countering domestic violence was an important part of
          President Clinton's crime bill. In addition, the
          President created the Violence Against Women Office in
          the Department of Justice and established a toll free
          number (1-800-799-SAFE) which has provided aid to
          thousands of battered women.</p>
          <p><b>October - Breast Cancer Awareness Month</b> Under
          the Clinton Administration, breast cancer research has
          increased by sixty-five percent. The President
          established key positions at the Department of Health and
          Human Services, the National Institutes of Health, the
          Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food
          and Drug Administration that focus specifically on
          women's health.</p>

          Weekend</b></p>
