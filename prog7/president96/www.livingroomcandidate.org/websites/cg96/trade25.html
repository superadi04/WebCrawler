              Minnesota is the country�s ninth largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $1.4 billion in
              agricultural exports abroad in 1994 (latest year
              available for Department of Agriculture state export
              data). The largest export categories, soybeans, feed
              grains and wheat, accounted for nearly 60 percent of
              Minnesota�s agricultural exports in 1994. Given the
              22 percent increase in total U.S. agriculture exports
              in 1995, agriculture exports from Minnesota in 1995
              will likely range between $1.6 billion and $1.8
              billion.
