              Virginia is the country�s 33rd largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $310 million in
              agricultural exports abroad in 1994 (latest year
              available for Department of Agriculture state export
              data). The largest export categories, tobacco and
              poultry, accounted for nearly 50 percent of
              Virginia�s agricultural exports in 1994. Given the 22
              percent increase in total U.S. agriculture exports in
              1995, agriculture exports from Virginia in 1995 will
              likely range between $350 million and $400 million.
