      PRESS RELEASE<br>
      September 25, 1996</tt>
      <p><tt>STATEMENT BY JOE LOCKHART<br>
      NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY</tt></p>
      <p><tt>Today, Bob Dole posed the right question: "what do you
      call someone who ... gave you the biggest tax increase in
      history?" But, he gave the wrong answer. The right answer is
      Bob Dole.</tt></p>
      <p><tt>In 1982, Bob Dole voted for the Tax Equity & Fiscal
      Responsibility Act which numerous economists and newspapers
      -- from the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> to the <i>New York
      Times</i> -- agree was the largest tax increase in peacetime
      history. In fact, not only did Bob Dole vote for the bill, he
      also wrote it.</tt></p>
      <p><tt>Here�s what Bob Dole�s running mate, Jack Kemp, had to
      say about Dole�s 1982 tax increase, "the largest tax increase
      ever passed in American history - about $1,600 for every man,
      woman, and child."(<i>St. Petersburg Times</i>,
      2/11/88)</tt></p>

        American history -- about $1600 for every man, woman, and

      <p><tt>On August 19, 1982, Bob Dole voted for the Tax Equity
      and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) -- the largest
      peacetime tax increase in history according to any reasonable
      analysis. Bob Dole authored and pushed for this tax increase
      that raised $298 billion over five years, in
      inflation-adjusted dollars. [HR 4691, 1982 CQ Almanac, Vote
      #335, p. 55-S; Wall Street Journal, 10/26/94; Joint Tax
      Committee, 6/23/93]</tt></p>
      <p><tt><i>New York Times</i>, 7/11/96:<br>
      "It is not true that the $240 billion tax increase approved
      by Congress in 1993 at Mr. Clinton's behest is the largest in
      American history. When adjusted for inflation -- the only way
      to make comparisons of dollar amounts from different years --
      a tax increase engineered by Mr. Dole in 1982, when he was
      the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, was
      larger."</tt></p>
      <p><tt><i>Wall Street Journal</i>, 10/26/94:<br>
      "Contrary to Republican claims, the 1993 package ... is not
      'the largest tax increase in history.' The 1982 deficit
      reduction package of President Reagan and Sen. Robert Dole in
      a GOP-controlled Senate was a bigger tax bill, both in
      1993-adjusted dollars and as a percentage of the overall
      economy."</tt></p>
      <p><tt>Joint Tax Committee, 6/23/93:<br>
      "[T]he tax increases proposed in the Administration's budget
      are smaller than the tax increases enacted in the Tax Equity
      and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA)."</tt></p>
      <p><tt><i>Los Angeles Times</i>, 8/7/93:<br>
      "Nor is the [1993] plan the biggest tax increase in history,
      as Republicans contended. With inflation factored in, the
      largest tax increase was the one enacted in 1982 under
      President Ronald Reagan and engineered in the Senate Finance
      Committee by its then-Chairman, Bob Dole."</tt></p>
      <p><tt><i>Christian Science Monitor</i>, 8/6/93:<br>
      "Senate minority leader Robert Dole called Mr. Clinton's plan
      the �largest tax increase in the history of the world.�
      Canceling out the exaggerations of inflation, however, this
      tax hike will not surpass the one drafted largely by Mr. Dole
      in 1982."</tt></p>
      <p><tt><b>THE DAY BEFORE BOB DOLE VOTED FOR THE LARGEST TAX
      INCREASE IN HISTORY, HE SAID THAT THE 1982 TAX INCREASE WAS
      "TOO SMALL"</b></tt></p>
      <p><tt>Bob Dole, August 18, 1982: "There is no doubt in my
      mind it is going to be a good bipartisan package. I am still
      hopeful the good Senator from South Carolina will come on
      board. Last year, the tax cut was too big, and this year the
      increase is too small. Somewhere down the line they may get
      together." [Source: Congressional Record, S-21869, 1982.
