    <b>ECONOMIC GROWTH</b>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> Under President Clinton, the private
    sector of the economy has grown 3.2 percent per year -- and
    that�s a stronger record of private-sector growth than either
    the Reagan (3.0%) or Bush (1.3%) Administrations. [Based on
    data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis] The conservative
    business magazine Barron�s concluded that President Clinton had
    a stronger economic record than any Republican Administration
    in the post-World War II era. And just 8 months ago, Bob Dole
    himself said that “It is also true, as some have said, that our
    economy is the strongest it�s been in 30 years.” [Bob Dole
    Remarks to the New Hampshire Legislature, 2/13/96]</p>
    <p>"It is also true, as some have said, that our economy is the
    strongest it's been in 30 years." [Dole Remarks before the New
    Hampshire State Legislature, 2/13/96]</p>
    <p>USA Today set the record straight on August 7, 1996: "The
    Bureau of Labor Statistics' consumer expenditure survey says
    that in 1994, the latest year for which figures are available,
    the average household -- not necessarily a two-income household
    -- spends $16,336 on food, clothing and housing vs. $5,897 on
    taxes, including property tax, Social Security payroll tax, and
    federal, state, and local income tax."</p>
    <p>After falling by 79 cents during the Reagan-Bush years,
    wages are now rising. [Based on data from the Bureau of Labor
    Statistics, 10/4/96] As Business Week wrote: "Real wages are
    rising for the first time in a decade." [3/11/96] According to
    the Census Bureau, real median household income increased more
    in 1995 than in any year in a decade, and the typical family's
    income, adjusted for inflation, has increased by $1,631 since
    1993. [Census Bureau, 9/26/96] Since President Clinton took
    office, every family income group -- from the poorest to the
    most well-off -- has seen their income increase. [Census
    Bureau, 9/26/96] <a name="tx" id="tx"></a></p>
    <p><b>TAXES</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> H&amp;R Block confirms that the
    President�s plan increased income tax rates only for the top
    1.2 percent, while cutting taxes for "16.6% of all taxpayers
    [who] benefit from the Earned Income Tax Credit Expansion."
    [H&amp;R Block Analysis, August 1993.] And the 1993 4-cent gas
    tax cost families only $3 a month -- all going towards cutting
    the deficit by sixty percent. But look at Dole�s record. During
    his 35 years in Washington, Dole hiked 450 different taxes and
    fees -- at least $900 billion to $2 trillion in higher taxes.
    [CQ Almanac, 1960-1992] Dole increased Social Security taxes,
    unemployment taxes, taxes and fees on Medicare, telephone
    taxes, gas taxes, automobile taxes, airline taxes, beer taxes,
    boat taxes, and vacation fees. [1982 CQ Almanac, p. 31-32; p.
    55-S, Vote # 337; 1990 CQ Almanac, p. 63-S, Vote # 326; 1983 CQ
    Almanac, p. 219; p. 12-S, Vote # 54; 1991 CQ Almanac, p. 308;
    p. 33-S, Vote # 254] <a name="md" id="md"></a></p>
    <p><b>MEDICARE</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> Bob Dole reaffirmed his vote against
    Medicare just last year. “I was there, fighting the fight,
    voting against Medicare -- one of 12 -- because we knew it
    wouldn�t work in 1965.” [Bob Dole Speech to the American
    Conservative Union 10/24/95]. The record shows that Senator
    Dole continues to try and cut Medicare. In 1995, Dole-Gingrich
    tried to cut Medicare by $270 billion, doubling premiums. Now
    83% of economists surveyed by The Economist said Dole would
    have to cut Medicare to balance the budget and enact his risky
    and unaffordable tax scheme. [Economist, October 5, 1996]
    Dole�s own Campaign Co-Chairman, Senator Al D�Amato, was more
    candid than the candidate: “You�re gonna have to look at
    Medicare...I mean, I�m not running this year, so I can say it
    and tell the truth.”[Don Imus Show, 8/12/96]</p>
    <p>President Clinton's balanced budget extends the life of the
    Trust Fund for a decade -- the same as the Republican budget
    plan. [Letter from Medicare Chief Actuary, 6/4/96.] The 1993
    Clinton Economic Plan, opposed by Senator Dole and enacted
    without a single Republican vote, extended the life of the
    Trust Fund by 3 years. [Medicare Actuary, 3/28/95] Republicans,
    who in 1995 tried to cut Medicare by $270 billion, don't even
    believe in the program: Senator Bob Dole said, "I was there,
    fighting the fight, one of twelve, voting against Medicare in
    1965 ... because we knew it wouldn't work." [American
    Conservative Union Speech, 10/24/95] <a name="bb" id=
    "bb"></a></p>
    <p><b>BALANCED BUDGET</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> The President�s balanced budget --
    including his new initiatives -- would cut spending by more
    than $500 billion to its lowest level in over 3 decades as a
    share of the economy [CBO, May 1996, and OMB, FY97 Budget
    Historical Tables, Table 1.2]. Under President Clinton,
    spending has declined each year as a share of the economy and
    is now lower than any year under Presidents Reagan or Bush.
    [OMB, FY97 Budget Historical Tables, Table 1.2] <a name="dt"
    id="dt"></a></p>
    <p><b>DOLE TAX PLAN</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> Dole�s “six percent” doesn�t include the
    more than $700 billion in cuts he simply assumes from last
    year�s vetoed and discredited Republican budget. Independent
    analyses, such as Time, Business Week, and the nonpartisan
    Concord Coalition say that Dole's plan will require between
    one-third to 40% cuts in domestic discretionary programs in
    2002. Time magazine wrote: "[A]nalysts say agencies from the
    FBI to the Transportation Department could face cuts as deep as
    40%...(including 300,000 fewer children in Head Start, 2,200
    fewer park rangers; 2,170 fewer Border Patrol agents, 2,960
    fewer DEA staff)." [Time, 9/23/96] <a name="cb" id=
    "cb"></a></p>
    <p><b>1993 CLINTON BUDGET</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> Every serious observer agrees that the
    1982 tax increase written by Senate Finance Committee Chairman
    Bob Dole is the largest in history. New York Times, 11/3/95:
    "It is not true that the $240 billion tax increase approved by
    Congress in 1993 at Mr. Clinton's behest is the largest in
    American history. When adjusted for inflation -- the only way
    to make comparisons of dollar amounts from different years -- a
    tax increase engineered by Mr. Dole in 1982, when he was the
    chairman of Senate Finance Committee, was larger. Unbelievably,
    Dole wanted an even bigger tax increase: He said, in an address
    on the Senate floor, “Last year, the tax cut was too big, and
    this year the tax increase is too small.”[Congressional Record,
    S-21869, 1982] <a name="tb" id="tb"></a></p>
    <p><b>TOBACCO</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> Bob Dole is consistently wrong on tobacco.
    The bill that Dole voted for in 1965 -- the so-called
    “Cigarette Labeling Act” -- was considered a “victory for the
    cigarette industry” according to Congressional Quarterly
    because it superceded regulations by the Federal Trade
    Commission, which would have required health warnings in
    cigarette advertising on radio, television, newspapers and
    other media. The bill that passed required health warnings only
    on cigarette packages and cartons, not advertising. [1965 CQ
    Almanac, vt. 90, p. 978, 7/13/65; 1965 CQ Almanac, p. 344].
    After taking almost $500,000 in campaign contributions, Bob
    Dole opposes President Clinton�s efforts to curb teen smoking.
    He has questioned whether smoking is addictive and compared the
    danger of smoking to the dangers of drinking milk. When he was
    attacked by former Surgeon General Koop for his statements,
    Dole said Koop had been brainwashed a little bit by the liberal
    media. [Washington Post, 6/22/96; AP, 6/20/96; ABC�s World News
    Tonight, 6/14/96; NBC, Today, 7/2/96, FEC, Better America
    Foundation Contributor List]. <a name="dg" id="dg"></a></p>
    <p><b>DRUGS</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> President Clinton has fought the drug war
    on all fronts. Casual drug use is down 13% among Americans
    between the ages of 18 and 35 since 1992 (Department of Health
    and Human Services, Substance Abuse/Mental Health Agency,
    8/20/96). Cocaine use is down 30% since 1992 (ONDCP, April
    1996). There is a record number of drug felons in federal
    prisons (Letter from Attorney General Reno to Senator Orrin
    Hatch, 9/26/96). Border Patrol drug seizures are up 22%
    (Department of Justice/ Immigration and Naturalization Service,
    07/0796). President Clinton has proposed and signed the largest
    anti-drug budgets in history, up 24% since FY93; he elevated
    the Office of National Drug Control Policy to Cabinet level
    status; and he appointed a four-star general, Barry McCaffrey,
    to lead the fight. By contrast, Bob Dole opposed the creation
    of the Drug Czar�s office in 1982 and voted against its
    extension in 1994. [1994 CQ Almanac, p.290] [CQ Almanac, 1982
    (p.64-S)] Bob Dole voted to cut the Safe and Drug Free Schools
    Program by 50%. The Dole-Gingrich budget cut $767 million for
    the President�s 1996 drug control budget and cut at risk youth
    drug programs by over 50%. [CQ, 1994, vt 321, Impact of House
    Appropriations Subcommittee mark, FY95-97.] <a name="bd" id=
    "bd"></a></p>
    <p><b>BRADY BILL</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> President Clinton led the fight to gain
    Congressional passage of the Brady Law. The Brady Law requires
    that a national Instant Criminal Background Check System be
    established by November 1998. The Department of Justice has
    already appropriated $112 million in funding for states to
    create instant check systems.[Atty. General�s Report to
    President, 9/13/95, DoJ 9/96] In 1993, Dole voted against
    passage of the Brady Bill. [1993 CQ Almanac, p. 302; p. 51-S,
    vote # 394]. Upon voting against final passage, Dole stated:
    “We lost one.”[Houston Chronicle, 11/25/93] Dole took the NRA
    position by leading the GOP filibuster of the Brady Bill,
    voting twice against cloture, despite the fact that the bill
    represented a compromise measure that he helped draft. [1993 CQ
    Almanac, p. 302; votes #387, #390, 11/19/93, p. 50-S] <a name=
    "iq" id="iq"></a></p>
    <p><b>IRAQ</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> Last month, Bill Clinton expanded the
    no-fly zone in southern Iraq in response to Saddam�s seizure of
    Irbil in the north -- tightening the strategic straightjacket
    on Saddam. It is now harder for Saddam to attack Saudi Arabia
    and Kuwait -- and easier for us to stop him if he does. In
    1993, he launched cruise missiles against Saddam�s intelligence
    headquarters to retaliate for the attempted assassination of
    President Bush in 1993; in 1994, Bill Clinton deployed American
    forces to counter Saddam�s deployment of forces toward Kuwait.
    Source: Senate Intelligence Committee testimony by DCI Deutch,
    Federal News Service, 9/19/96.</p>
    <p>Bob Dole�s record suggests that Saddam would be better off
    if Dole had been President. In 1990, three and one-half months
    before the invasion, Bob Dole met with Saddam in Iraq, and upon
    his return declared that Saddam is an “intelligent man,” a
    “leader to whom [we] can talk,” and that there was a “chance to
    bring this guy around.” A month later, he derailed sanctions
    against Saddam for his threat to burn up half of Israel. On
    July 27, 1990 -- on the eve of Saddam�s invasion of Kuwait --
    Dole tried to weaken the same sanctions. In December, 1990, he
    equated Israel�s actions to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait when
    he suggested that Israel may have to give up the Occupied
    Territories as part of a solution to the Gulf crisis. Sources:
    Congressional Record, 4/20/90, p. S 4788 (Saddam is intelligent
    man); Reader�s Digest, January, 1991 (leader to whom we can
    talk) (Washington Post, 4/23/90 (Saddam can be brought around);
    Congressional Record, 5/17/90, pp. S6427-28, S6442-43
    (derailing of sanctions); Congressional Record, 7/26/90, pp.

    oil); Kansas City Star, 12/5/90. <a name="CA" id="CA"></a></p>
    <p><b>CALIFORNIA</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> Californians are clearly better off than
    they were four years ago. After California�s unemployment rate
    had increased from 5.0 percent to 9.7 percent during the Bush
    Administration, the unemployment rate in California has fallen
    from 9.7 percent to 7.0 percent. [Bureau of Labor Statistics,
    10/96] After California lost 57,900 jobs during the Bush years,
    the California economy has added nearly 700,000 new jobs since
    President Clinton took office. [Bureau of Labor Statistics,
    10/96] And consumer confidence in California has increased 56
    percent since President Clinton took office. [Conference Board,
    9/96] <a name="si" id="si"></a></p>
    <p><b>SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> Dole�s regulatory reform bill was heavily
    influenced by lobbyists, many of whom have contributed to
    Dole�s political efforts. According to Congressional Quarterly,
    “Dole has relied closely for drafting advice on outside
    lobbyists, representing businesses and trade associations, many
    of which have contributed to his presidential campaign and have
    a direct financial interest in a lighter regulatory burden.”
    And, according to the New York Times, “...seldom in the past
    have Congressional staff members so openly and publicly
    embraced legislative outsiders with extensive interests in the
    outcome.” [CQ Weekly, 5/6/95, p. 1219-20; New York Times,
    3/31/95] <a name="ed" id="ed"></a></p>
    <p><b>EDUCATION</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> Bob Dole has a 35-year record of voting
    against education. In 1964 he voted against the creation of
    Head Start [CQ Almanac, 1964], in 1965 he was 1 of only 63
    representatives to vote against the creation of the federal
    student loan program [CQ Almanac, 1965 (vote #169), 10/25/65],
    and in 1979 he voted against the creation of the Education
    Department [Senate vote #1070, 4/30/79]. In 1995, he teamed up
    with Newt Gingrich to write the most anti-education budget in
    history, which would have cut education and training by $31
    billion [FY96 budget resolution conference agreement; CBO
    analysis of the HR 2491, 11/16/95], and voted to cut student
    loans [CQ Almanac, 1995, vote #231].<br>
