    PRESS RELEASE</tt>
    <p><tt>CLINTON/GORE '96 APPOINTS NEW ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF

    <p><tt>President Clinton and Vice President Gore have taken the
    lead on issues important to all Asian Pacific Americans
    including:</tt></p>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>Expanding trade markets in Asia and the Pacific for
      U.S. exports;</tt></li>
      <li><tt>Appointing 195 Asian Pacific American political
      appointees to this Administration;</tt></li>
      <li><tt>Signing the Family and Medical Leave Act so workers
      can take time off to care for sick members without losing
      their jobs;</tt></li>
      <li><tt>Increasing access to college by reforming student
      loans and expanding work study;</tt></li>
      <li><tt>Establishing Americorps, young people now have the
      opportunity to serve their communities while earning money
      for college.</tt></li>
    </ul>
    <p><tt>Ms. Singh joins Clinton/Gore '96 from the Democratic

    APAs and they truly are part of the diversity of support that
    is testament to President Clinton and Vice President Gore's
    outstanding record of accomplishments and their understanding
