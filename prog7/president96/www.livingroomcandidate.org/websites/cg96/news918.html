    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    September 18, 1996</tt>
    <p><tt>PROMINENT ELECTED OFFICIALS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERTS
    HOLD NEWS EVENTS NATIONWIDE BACKING PRESIDENT CLINTON�S CRIME
    FIGHTING RECORD</tt></p>
    <p><tt>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Nationally prominent elected
    officials and law enforcement experts are holding news events
    in Washington, D.C. and in 46 states across the nation today
    backing President Clinton�s strong crime fighting record,
    announced Clinton/Gore �96 Campaign Manager Peter S.
    Knight.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>This nationwide response comes one day after the
    Department of Justice�s Bureau of Justice Statistics released a
    new report showing the sharpest decrease in violent crime in
    eight years. It also follows major endorsements of President
    Clinton by the Fraternal Order of Police, the National
    Association of Police Organizations, and the International
    Union of Police Associations.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"President Clinton doesn�t point fingers, he points the
    nation in the right direction for fighting crime and drugs,"
    said Knight. "In four years, the President has moved past
    decades of tough talk to implement a solid record of tough
    action," he added.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The President�s anti-crime achievements include signing
    a crime bill that banned the deadliest assault weapons, created
    a 24-hour Domestic Violence Hotline, provided the death penalty
    for drug kingpins and is putting 100,000 police on the streets.
    In addition to passing the Brady Bill, President Clinton
    provided grants to fight gangs and youth violence, and expanded
    the �Safe and Drug Free Schools� initiative which benefits 40
    million children in 97 percent of America�s school
    districts.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>News events highlighting President Clinton�s strong
    crime fighting record -- and contrasting it with Bob Dole�s --
    are being held today in states from coast to coast (see a list
    of contacts attached).</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Participants in the Washington, D.C. news conference
    include Chris Dodd, who is a Senator from Connecticut; Bob
    Miller who is Governor of Nevada; Dianne Feinstein who is a
    Senator from California; John Conyers who is a Congressman from
    Michigan; Jim Brady who is a former Reagan Administration Press
    Secretary; Scott Harshbarger who is President of the National
    Association of Attorneys General and Massachusetts Attorney
    General; Thomas C. Frazier who is Baltimore City Police
    Commissioner; Patricia C. Jessamy who is Baltimore City State�s
    Attorney; Bob Scully who is Executive Director of the National
    Association of Police Organizations; Robert Robbins, who is a
    senior member of the Legislative Committee of the National
    Fraternal Order of Police; and Art Reddy who is Vice President
    of the International Union of Police Associations.</tt></p>
