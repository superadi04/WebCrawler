              South Dakota is the country�s 22nd largest
              agricultural exporting state, shipping $673 million
              in agricultural exports abroad or 1.5% of the U.S.
              total in 1994 (latest year available for Department
              of Agriculture state export data). Large export
              product categories included wheat, feed grains and
              soybeans. These three categories accounted for over
              70 percent of South Dakota�s agricultural exports in
              1994. Given the 22 percent increase in total U.S.
              agriculture exports in 1995, agriculture exports from
              South Dakota in 1995 will likely range between $800
              million and $850 million.
