      <tt><b>"Yes," Jack Kemp responding to Sam Donaldson�s
      question, "Will you please submit, you and Senator Dole, your
      plan for a $548 billion tax cut to the CBO so they can run
      the numbers and tell the American people whether, in fact,
      you have a chance of making it ... Will you do it?" (ABC�s
      This Week with David Brinkley, 10/13/96)</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>We�re glad that Jack Kemp agreed, at last, to provide
    the necessary details on Bob Dole�s risky, $548 billion
    economic plan so that Majority Leader Trent Lott or Speaker
    Newt Gingrich can submit the Dole economic plan to the
    Congressional Budget Office (CBO) before the election for an
    independent analysis of its impact on the economy.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>If Bob Dole really "trusts the people" he should follow
    Ronald Reagan�s lead and "trust, but verify."</tt></p>
