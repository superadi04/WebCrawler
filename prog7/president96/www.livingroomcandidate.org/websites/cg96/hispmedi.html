    <p><tt>PRESS RELEASE<br>
    September 26, 1996</tt></p>
    <p><tt>PRESIDENT�S FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT:<br>
    A SUCCESS FOR HISPANIC AMERICANS</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Washington -- President Clinton�s Family and Medical
    Leave Act (FMLA) continues to be a winner for Latinos. Thanks
    to the law, millions of workers have been able to take time off
    from work to care for a sick family member without fear of
    losing their jobs.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Since President Clinton signed the Family and Medical
    Leave Act, employees across America have taken over 12 million
    job-protected leaves. In addition, 67 million eligible
    employees can rely on the FMLA if and when they need its
    protections.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"Besides being family-friendly, the Family and Medical
    Leave Act has not created significant costs or burdens on
    businesses. Many employers have found the law to be a plus,
    contributing to increased productivity and reduced turnover,"
    said Alan Wheat, Deputy Campaign Manager and Director of Public
    Liaison.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton has proposed expanding the Family and
    Medical Leave Act to allow working parents that extra
    flexibility through an additional 24 hours of leave a year for
    parent-teacher conferences and preventive medical
    check-ups.</tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>"This bill has already helped millions of families.
    It�s in the best interest of Latino families, and it should be
    expanded. Latinos should support the President in his efforts
    to do just that," said Ken Mireles, Clinton/Gore �96 Director
    of Hispanic Outreach.</b></tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole, on the other hand, is opposed to the law. He
    voted against it while in the Senate and is against expanding
    the law as outlined by President Clinton.</tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>"Four years ago on this same date, then-Republican
    Leader Bob Dole cast his vote to uphold President Bush�s veto
    of the Family and Medical Leave Act. Today, he�s still against
    it. He was wrong then, and he�s wrong now," said Michael T.
    Carbone, Clinton/Gore �96 Executive Director of Hispanic
    Outreach.</b></tt></p>
