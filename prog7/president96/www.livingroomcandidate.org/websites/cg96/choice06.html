<P>PRESS RELEASE
<BR>August 6, 1996


	<P>STATEMENT BY ANN LEWIS
<BR> DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER

<P>    Two months ago Bob Dole said that his platform would definitely include tolerance language on the issue of abortion:

<P><I>	 "It has been resolved. I think I make that decision--it’s not 			negotiable.  It’s the decision.  And that’s going to be in the plank."</I>
                        (CNN Inside Politics 6/10/96)

<P>      Yesterday, Bob Dole agreed to the demands by Pat Robertson and Pat Buchanan, and walked away from his own commitment to "tolerance" toward those Republicans who support a woman’s right to choose.  Now the 1996 Republican platform, like Bob Dole’s record, is clearly and consistently anti-choice. 
      
<P>     Bob Dole opposed Roe v. Wade; voted against ending the gag rule in family planning clinics; and voted against the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act which protects clinics from violence.   His platform will oppose Roe v. Wade.  His platform will call for a constitutional amendment that would make abortion illegal for every woman in every state.  His platform will demand the appointment of judges who meet an anti-abortion litmus test. 

<P>     With his decision to abandon mainstream Republicans, and adopt Pat Robertson’s and Pat Buchanan’s definition of "tolerance," all traces of Bob Dole’s reported move to the center have been erased.
