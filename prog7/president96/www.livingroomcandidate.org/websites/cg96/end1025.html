    "President Clinton has consistently fought for the issues which

    100,000 cops on the street, and promoted future security with
    strong economic policies. He also signed the Family and Medical
    Leave Act into law, making it easier for young, working
    families to deal with the demands of work and of raising
    children.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"The President�s vision of the future makes America�s
    youth a top priority," added Sarah Lichtman, Director of Youth
    Outreach for Clinton/Gore �96. "President Clinton�s measured
    and thoughtful efforts to improve the lives, the future, and
    the communities of young people have yielded an unparalleled
    record of accomplishment," she said.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>In welcoming the efforts of the National Youth Steering
    Committee and the State Youth Advisory Committees, Clinton/Gore
    �96 Deputy Campaign Manager Alan Wheat said, "Young people are
    crucial to this election. The Committee�s broad appeal reflects
    the breadth and depth of support for President Clinton�s
    positions from all types of young people from students to
    community activists to young entrepreneurs."</tt></p>
