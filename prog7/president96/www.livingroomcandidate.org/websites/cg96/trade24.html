              Wisconsin is the country�s 15th largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $912 million in
              agricultural exports abroad or 2.1% of the U.S. total
              in 1994 (latest year available for Department of
              Agriculture state export data). The largest export
              categories, feed grains, dairy products, and
              vegetables, accounted for over 55 percent of
              Wisconsin�s agricultural exports in 1994. Given the
              22 percent increase in total U.S. agriculture exports
              in 1995, agriculture exports from Wisconsin in 1995
              will likely range between $1.0 billion and $1.2
              billion.
