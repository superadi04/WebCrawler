    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    September 20, 1996</tt>
    <p><tt>FIRST LADY HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON<br>
    TO DISCUSS FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT<br>
    IN CONNECTICUT ON SEPTEMBER 24, 1996</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Washington, D.C. -- First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
    will be in New London, Connecticut on Tuesday, September 24, to
    highlight President Clinton�s commitment to working families
    through the Family and Medical Leave Act. Congressman Sam
    Gejdenson will join Mrs. Clinton at a discussion with families
    who have benefited from the legislation. During the visit, Mrs.
    Clinton will also stress the President�s commitment to expand
    the Family and Medical Leave Act in a second term.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The Family and Medical Leave Act was the first bill
    signed into law by President Clinton. The Act allows workers at
    businesses with 50 or more employees to take up to 12 weeks of
    unpaid, job-protected leave to care for a newborn or adopted
    child, to attend to their own serious health needs, or to care
    for a seriously ill parent, child, or spouse.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Connecticut is a leading proponent of family leave
    legislation, having passed a state law in 1989. A total of
    670,000 workers are eligible for family leave in Connecticut
    under the national Family and Medical Leave Act. Since
    President Clinton signed the bill into law in February of 1993,
    employees across America have taken more than 12 million
    job-protected leaves.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>On Tuesday, Clinton-Gore �96 will highlight the law
    nationwide. Four years ago on this same date, then-Republican
    Leader Bob Dole cast his vote to uphold President Bush�s veto
    of the Family and Medical Leave Act.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>A detailed schedule of the First Lady�s events in
    Connecticut will be available on Monday, September 23.</tt></p>
