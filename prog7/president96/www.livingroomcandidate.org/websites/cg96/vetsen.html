    <p><tt>For Immediate Release<br>
    October 17, 1996</tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>TOM DASCHLE AND JIM EXON JOIN "VETERANS FOR
    CLINTON/GORE"</b></tt></p>
    <p><tt>The Clinton/Gore campaign today announced that Tom
    Daschle, who is a U.S. Senator from South Dakota, and Jim Exon,
    who is a U.S. Senator from Nebraska, have been named Honorary
    Vice Chairs of the "Veterans for Clinton/Gore National Steering
    Committee."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"I am proud to join the many prominent veterans who
    support President Clinton�s re-election. He has compiled a
    far-reaching record in service to America�s veterans," said
    Senator Daschle. "President Clinton has shielded veterans�
    compensation and health care from budget cuts. He also expanded
    compensation eligibility for Vietnam veterans and their
    children suffering from illnesses associated with exposure to
    Agent Orange."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Tom Daschle and Jim Exon join a group which already
    includes twelve members of Congress, four Medal of Honor
    winners, five past national commanders of major veterans�
    groups, and other prominent veterans such as Jesse Brown, who
    is Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Hershel Gober, who is Deputy
    Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, Jr.
    (ret.), and Lieutenant General Thomas Kelly (ret.).</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"In the area of veterans� employment, President Clinton
    has increased the percentage of new federal jobs going to
    veterans by ten points, helped 1.5 million veterans find
    civilian jobs, and cut the unemployment rate among veterans by
    a third," said Senator Exon. "He has always protected and
    enhanced veterans� health care."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The national steering committee, which was launched on
    September 26, 1996, will organize the nation�s 26 million
    veterans and their families to support the reelection of
    President Clinton and Vice President Gore.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"We are delighted to have Tom Daschle and Jim Exon on
    our team," said Alan Wheat, Deputy Campaign Manager and
    Director of Public Liaison. "They will be eloquent spokesmen
    for President Clinton�s record on veterans� issues."</tt></p>
