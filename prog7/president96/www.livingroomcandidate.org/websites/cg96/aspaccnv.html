    <p><tt>PRESS RELEASE<br>
    September 6, 1996</tt></p>
    <p><tt>ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICANS UNITE AT THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL
    CONVENTION</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Asian Pacific Americans came to Chicago to unite with
    fellow Democrats and to celebrate President Clinton�s
    outstanding record of accomplishments. Asian Pacific American
    political appointees, opinion leaders, and 162 Asian Pacific
    American delegates took part in convention proceedings to
    organize and further increase their involvement in the general
    election. Members of the Asian Pacific American press also
    covered the convention and were hosted at a media roundtable
    where Alan Wheat, Deputy Campaign Manager and Director of
    Public Liaison for Clinton/Gore �96; Congressman Robert Matsui;
    and Sharon Singh, National Director of the Asian Pacific
    American Outreach Office at Clinton/Gore �96 discussed how
    Asian Pacific Americans are increasing support behind President
    Clinton.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>During the convention, President Clinton -- on his train
    trip, "The 21st Century Express" -- focused on the core
    principles underlying his and Vice President Gore�s leadership
    agenda: opportunity, responsibility, and community. On Monday,
    August 26, the President announced new crime initiatives that
    would keep guns out of the hands of domestic violent offenders,
    outlaw cop killer bullets, provide "gun-free" school zones and
    promote tougher sentences for gun-toting drug dealers. On
    Tuesday, August 27, he announced his new "America Reads"
    education initiative designed to ensure that every child is
    literate by the end of third grade. On Wednesday, August 28,
    President Clinton announced a new environmental initiative to
    protect all communities from toxic pollution. In his acceptance
    speech, he presented a comprehensive vision and agenda for the
    21st century.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"The Democratic convention was a sharp contrast to the
    Republican convention. We focused on substantive issues, not
    petty insults. We talked about a bridge to the future, not the
    past. And we talked about policies that help our families and
    children -- better and higher paying jobs, better health care
    coverage, and increased access to education," said Singh.
    "Asian Pacific Americans were proud to be part of this historic
    event. We are ready to work hard to re-elect President Bill
    Clinton and Vice President Al Gore"</tt></p>
