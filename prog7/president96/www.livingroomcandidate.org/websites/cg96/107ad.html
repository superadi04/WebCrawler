<P><B><CENTER>CLINTON/GORE ‘96 RELEASES NEW ADVERTISEMENT</CENTER></B>


<P>
Today, October 7, 1996, the Clinton/Gore ‘96 campaign announces a new ad entitled, "Responsibility."  The text of the ad follows:


<p><i><b>Responsibility</b></i>

<p><i>You take responsibility for yourself and your family.

<p>President Clinton is making people on welfare take responsibility.

<p>He signed tough welfare reform.  Work requirements.  Time limits.  Force teenage mothers to stay in school or lose benefits.

<p>The next step: create jobs.  Tax incentives for businesses that hire welfare recipients.  Job training for all workers.

<p>Dole/Gingrich tried to cut job training.  Wrong for our future.

<p>President Clinton.  Moving people from welfare to work.  Meeting our challenges.
