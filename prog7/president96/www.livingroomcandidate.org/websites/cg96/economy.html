    <font size="+1" color="#BE0023"><b>When President Clinton took
    office, America's economy was drifting. The deficit was
    skyrocketing, unemployment was high, and job growth was anemic.
    In 1993, the President put into place an Economic Plan to
    reduce the deficit, invest in our people, and get our country
    moving again.</b></font> &nbsp;
    <p>Four years later, America's economy is on the right track to
    the 21st century. Americans have created 10.5 million new jobs,
    93 percent in the private sector. Basic industries have
    rebounded, with 931,000 new construction jobs and nearly
    120,000 new manufacturing jobs. We have the lowest combined
    rate of unemployment, inflation, and mortgage rates since 1968.
    Consumer confidence is at its highest level in six years. Our
    high-tech industries -- like semiconductors and biotech -- lead
    the world. America is selling more cars than Japan for the
    first time since the 1970s.</p>
    <p>Our growing economy is giving parents greater opportunity to
    provide for their children. The typical family's income is up
    $1,600 since passage of President Clinton's 1993 Economic Plan.
    Real wages are rising for the first time in a decade.
    Homeownership is at a 15-year high.</p>
    <p>President Clinton is promoting economic growth and building
    a bridge to the 21st century by:</p>
