    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    October 21, 1996</tt>
    <center>
      <tt><b>STATEMENT BY ANN LEWIS<br>
      DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>President Clinton�s economic leadership has improved the
    lives of America�s working families by increasing American
    workers� incomes and keeping inflation low and stable. Today�s
    economic report is further proof that President Clinton�s
    economic policies put America on the right track.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The economy has grown at a rate of nearly three percent
    this year -- far stronger than the Republican Congress
    forecasted even if their budget had been passed. We now have
    10.5 million new jobs and an unemployment rate of 5.2 percent
    -- not surprisingly, consumer confidence is at a six year
    high.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Here are the facts:</tt></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>Economic growth this year has averaged 2.9% (at an
      annual rate) -- far surpassing CBO expectations of 2.0% and
      OMB�s projected growth of 2.2%.</tt></p>
      <p><tt>The private sector grew 3.0% in the third quarter (at
      an annual rate). Under President Clinton, the private sector
      has grown 3.2% per year, compared to 1.3% under President
      Bush and 3.0 percent under President Reagan.</tt></p>
      <p><tt>Business investment increased at a remarkable 18.9%
      annual rate in the last quarter. Under President Clinton,
      investment has increased at an 11.1% rate -- stronger than
      any Administration since President Kennedy.</tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><tt>President Clinton�s record of fiscal leadership is
    strong and clear. The American people know they can count on
    him to provide the economic security and fiscal responsibility
    needed to lead our country into the 21st century.</tt></p>
