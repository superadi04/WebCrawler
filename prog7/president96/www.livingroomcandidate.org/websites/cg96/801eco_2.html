    8/1/96<br>
    PRESS RELEASE</tt>
    <p><tt>AS SENATOR DOLE SAID...THIS IS THE BEST ECONOMY IN 30
    YEARS</tt></p>
    <p><tt>During the 1996 Republican primary in New Hampshire, Bob
    Dole had a rare moment of positive candor. Speaking to the New
    Hampshire State Legislature, Dole said: "It is also true as
    some have said, that our economy is the strongest it's been in
    30 years..."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>That is true. And the second quarter economic growth
    numbers released by the Commerce Department today -- showing
    the economy growing at 4.2 percent -- demonstrate that the
    economy continues to improve under President Clinton's
    leadership.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The President is working hard to build on this record,
    to ensure that the economy continues to grow and that all
    working American families feel the positive benefits. No thanks
    to Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich. Given today's strong economic
    numbers, Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich have no credibility on
    economics -- even as they publicly flounder in their search for
    a Republican economic plan.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Dole and Gingrich predicted that the sky would fall if
    the President�s plan passed.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Here's what Senator Dole had to say:</tt></p>
    <blockquote>
      <tt>"The Clinton plan does not solve the deficit problems. It
      will not keep the economy moving, and it will not create
      jobs" (April 5, 1993)</tt>
    </blockquote>
    <p><tt>But despite their negative "Chicken Little" predictions,
    the President's positive economic record speaks for
    itself.</tt></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>The deficit has been cut in half.</tt></p>
      <p><tt>The economy is growing -- at 4.2 percent.</tt></p>
      <p><tt>10 million new jobs have been created.</tt></p>
      <p><tt>Wages are growing for the first time in over a
      decade.</tt></p>

    <p><tt>The Prediction: Bob Dole On The President's Economic
    Strategy In 1993</tt></p>
    <blockquote>
      <tt>"The Clinton plan does not solve the deficit problems. It
      will not keep the economy moving, and it will not create
      jobs."<br>
      -- Congressional Record, 4/5/93 (p. 4541)</tt>

    <p><tt>The Facts: President Clinton�s Economic Record</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Strong Economic Growth:</tt></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>The Commerce Department reported today that the
      nation's economy grew at a 4.2% annual rate in the second
      quarter of this year.<br>
      [Commerce Department, 8/1/96]</tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><tt>Ten Million New Jobs:</tt></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>Under President Clinton's leadership, the economy has
      created 10 million jobs in 41 months.<br>
      [Labor Department]</tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><tt>Deficit Cut More Than In Half :</tt></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>President Clinton has cut the deficit in half from
      $290 billion in 1992 to $117 billion this year. President
      Clinton is the first President to cut the deficit for four
      years in a row since the 1840s.<br>

    </blockquote>
    <p><tt>Unemployment Is At Its Lowest Level In Six
    Years:</tt></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>The unemployment rate is now 5.3% -- its lowest level
      in six years and 22nd consecutive month below 6%. The
      unemployment rate averaged 7.5% in 1992.<br>
      [Labor Department]</tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><tt>Wages Are Up:</tt></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>After dropping 79 cents in the previous two
      Administrations, average hourly earnings have increased
      slightly under President Clinton. In 1996, more than 50% of
      all new jobs are in high-wage industries. Since President
      Clinton has taken office, nearly four million jobs have been
      created in high-wage industries.<br>
