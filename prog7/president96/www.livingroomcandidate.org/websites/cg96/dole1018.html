    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    October 18, 1996</tt>
    <center>
      <tt><b>STATEMENT BY JOE LOCKHART<br>
      NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>Clearly when it comes to learning lessons from
    Watergate, Bob Dole is the best teacher. Twenty-six year old
    documents released yesterday by the National Archives make one
    thing clear. Bob Dole has made a career out of negative
    politics -- and choosing insults over ideas.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>In an internal Nixon White House memorandum dated
    February 10, 1970, Nixon advisor "P.J. Buchanan" writes to
    President Nixon that "Dole recommended that
    Republicans...initiate politically inspired investigations..."
    Buchanan calls the Dole idea "a good one" and notes that "some
    publicity-garnering Congressional Investigations might redound
    to our political advantage."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Another internal White House memo (released earlier by
    the National Archives) dated March 27, 1970 identifies Dole as
    the "starter" who would receive ideas that "merit partisan
    investigation" and give "assignments" to other Republican
    Senators.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>In this election, Bob Dole has replaced Richard Nixon
    with Newt Gingrich -- who repeated history on June 4, 1996 by
    telling a meeting of Republicans that scandal mongering "is
    what this election is going to be all about." (New York Post,
    6/5/96)</tt></p>
    <p><tt>With Bob Dole insults, innuendo and partisan
    investigation have sadly always come before ideas. And look at
    the ideas Bob Dole has opposed over his 35 years in
    Washington:</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole voted against creating Medicare in 1965 and
    bragged about it in 1995, saying "I was there, fighting the
    fight, voting against Medicare -- one of twelve, because we
    knew it wouldn�t work in 1965." Dole voted against creating
    student loans in 1965, against the Department of Education in
    1979, repeatedly against a higher minimum wage, against
    creating a drug czar in 1982 and against the Brady Bill and
    Family and Medical Leave in the 1990s.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The 26-year-old internal Nixon White House memo released
    yesterday demonstrates one thing clearly. Bob Dole�s decision
    to spend the last weeks of this campaign attacking the
    President -- instead of offering ideas or his vision for the
    future -- is sadly consistent with his 35 year record as a
    Washington politician.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The American people have a clear choice between a
    President with a record of accomplishment and forward-looking
    plan for the 21st Century -- and a candidate with a three
    decade record of focusing on negative, attack politics rather
    than offering a positive agenda.</tt></p>
