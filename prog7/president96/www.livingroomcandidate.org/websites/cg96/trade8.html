              North Carolina is the country�s 13th largest
              agricultural exporting state, shipping $1.1 billion
              in agricultural exports abroad or 2.4% of the U.S.
              total in 1994 (latest year available for Department
              of Agriculture state export data). The largest export
              category, tobacco, accounted for over half of North
              Carolina�s agricultural exports in 1994. Given the 22
              percent increase in total U.S. agriculture exports in
              1995, agriculture exports from North Carolina in 1995
              will likely range between $1.2 billion and $1.4
              billion.
