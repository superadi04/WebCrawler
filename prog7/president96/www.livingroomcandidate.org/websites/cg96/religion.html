    firmly believes that religion is an issue that should draw us
    together — strengthening, rather than dividing, our
    communities. He has worked hard to help people of different
    faiths find common ground while adhering to the spirit of the
    First Amendment and its imperative that our government must
    neither establish nor interfere with religion, but rather
    respect the role religion plays in our families and in our
    nation.

            one of the most important civil rights bills for
            religion in American history. Supported by nearly 70
            civic and religious groups, the RFRA mandates that
            government cannot interfere with religious practice
            unless health and/or safety are jeopardized. Even then,
            the government must pursue its interest in the manner

            challenged Dillard Department Store�s mandatory weekend
