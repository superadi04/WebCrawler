<BR>PRESS RELEASE
<BR>August 5, 1996



<P>EXCERPTED REMARKS OF VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE
<BR>BEFORE 
THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS

<p>Cincinnati, OH
<br>August 3, 1996

 
<P>	President Clinton also understands that even with the latest technology, often a high school diploma is not enough.  And the time has come to make two years of education after high school just as universal as a high school education is now.

<P>	So -- in addition to our $10,000 tax deduction for the cost of college tuition -- the President has proposed a tax credit of $1,500 a year for the cost of going to a local community college...so every citizen can have that opportunity.

<P>	There couldn’t be a sharper contrast to Senator Dole.  What President Clinton proposed is a tax cut -- much like the EITC -- specifically targeted at real problems for real people...a plan that doesn’t rely on incentives that will never trickle down, but rather on opportunity and jobs and growth that will, along with the hope of our educators and students, shoot up.

<P>	When Bob Dole unveils his economic policy on Monday...watch closely.

<P>	Bob Dole's economic plan will blow a hole in the deficit and as <i>Business Week</i> said August 3, 1996, "could raise interest rates and lower long term growth".  Candidate Dole’s economic plan leads the retreat from balancing the budget and contradicts everything Senator Dole has said about deficit reduction with honest numbers.
