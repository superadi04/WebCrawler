      <tt><b>Prominent Veterans' Leaders Across the Nation Endorse
      Re-election of President Clinton and Vice President
      Gore</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>WASHINGTON — Prominent veterans� leaders and American
    heroes from past conflicts today declared their full support
    for the re-election of President Bill Clinton and Vice
    President Al Gore. At a news conference in Washington, D.C. and
    in press activities in 33 states, they announced the creation
    of the "National Veterans for Clinton/Gore Steering
    Committee."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>In Washington, Jesse Brown, who is the Secretary of
    Veterans Affairs and a honorary co-chair of the Committee,
    stated, "President Clinton has done more to help our nation's
    veterans than any President since FDR signed the G.I. Bill.
    Veterans everywhere should know that the President has kept his
    promise to veterans with deeds not words to honor the service
    and sacrifice of every man and woman in uniform." Hershel Gober
    who is the Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs and a honorary
    co-chair, added, "We intend to make certain that the
    Republicans do not distort or misrepresent that
    record."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>In addition to Jesse Brown, other prominent members on
    the national steering committee, all of whom have impeccable
    military credentials, include: Admiral Elmo Russell Zumwalt,
    Jr. (ret.), former Chief of Naval Operations and a member of
    the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1970 to 1974; William C.
    Ferguson, a member of the Tuskegee Airmen; Brigadier General
    Pat Foote (ret.), former Commanding General of Fort Belvoir and
    one of the highest-ranking females to serve in the military;
    and Lt. General Thomas W. Kelly (ret.), former Director of
    Operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. (Attached is a full
    list of steering committee members).</tt></p>
    <p><tt>In addition to the national committee, state advisory
    committees are being established to rally veterans in every
    state behind the Clinton/Gore ticket. The state advisory
    committees will be especially active in California, New York,
    Pennsylvania, Florida, and Michigan — where there are large
    veterans populations. The committees� will educate veterans
    everywhere about the President�s initiatives, conduct grass
    roots activities, and encourage veterans to vote for the
    President and a Democratic Congress on November 5.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Mr. James Dean, former National Commander of the
    American Legion, stated "I have been very impressed with the
    number of veterans contacting me in the past months indicating
    their strong support for re-electing the President and Vice
    President. We are looking forward to their victory in
    November."</tt></p>
