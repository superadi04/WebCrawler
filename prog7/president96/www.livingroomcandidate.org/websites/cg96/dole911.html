    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    September 11, 1996</tt>
    <p><tt>STATEMENT BY JOE LOCKHART<br>
    NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Today, Bob Dole and Jack Kemp went to Capitol Hill to
    get the blessing of Newt Gingrich and to reassure their troops
    that they will continue the "Republican revolution."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The Dole-Gingrich "revolution" would have cut Medicare
    by $270 billion -- the deepest cuts in history -- to pay for a
    $245 billion tax cut. If President Clinton had not held firm,
    the Dole-Gingrich Congress also would have raised taxes on
    eight million families, repealed the assault weapons ban, cut
    head start for preschool children, ended the federal guarantee
    of a school lunch, and cut college scholarships.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole doesn�t need to convince Hill Republicans. Bob
    Dole needs to be straight with the American people and tell
    them what he intends to cut this time to pay for his huge $550
    billion tax cut.</tt></p>

      <tt><b>The Dole/Gingrich/Kemp<br>
      "Revolution" "</b></tt>
      <p><tt><b>The great part about it is, come January, Newt's
      going to be able to work with a Republican<br>
      president."</b><br>
      -- Bob Dole</tt></p>
      <p><tt>Bob Dole and Jack Kemp visited Capitol Hill today to
      check in with the third member of their team -- Newt
      Gingrich. Jack Kemp made the Dole/Gingrich/Kemp ticket�s
      intentions clear today when he said, "...we can complete the
      revolution." In 1995, Dole said, "The revolution's started,
      and if we're going to finish it, we need someone in the White
      House, as I said, who can bring about change and I'll hope
      the people who believe that will stand beside me in this
      campaign." (WMUR-TV (NH) debate, CNN, 10/11/95) In June 1996,
      Dole said, "The great part about it is, come January, Newt's
      going to be able to work with a Republican president."
