              Hawaii is the country�s 38th largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $92 million in agricultural
              exports abroad in 1994 (latest year available for
              Department of Agriculture state export data). The
              largest export category, fruits, accounted for nearly
              50 percent of Hawaii�s agricultural exports in 1994.
              Given the 22 percent increase in total U.S.
              agriculture exports in 1995, agriculture exports from
              the Hawaii in 1995 will likely range between $105
              million and $115 million.
