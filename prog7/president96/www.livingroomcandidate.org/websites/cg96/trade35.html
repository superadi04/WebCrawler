              Arizona is the country�s 31st largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $339 million in
              agricultural exports abroad or 0.8% of the U.S. total
              in 1994 (latest year available for Department of
              Agriculture state export data). The largest export
              category, cotton and linters, accounted for over 37
              percent of Arizona�s agricultural exports in 1994.
              Given the 22 percent increase in total U.S.
              agriculture exports in 1995, agriculture exports from
              the state of Arizona in 1995 will likely range
              between $390 million and $430 million.
