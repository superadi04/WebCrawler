    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    September 23, 1996</tt>
    <p><tt>FORTY-FOUR STATES TO HOLD �FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE DAY�
    NEWS EVENTS TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPACT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON�S
    LAW</tt></p>
    <p><tt>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The Clinton/Gore campaign today
    announced that it will celebrate �Family and Medical Leave
    Day,� on September 24, 1996. On this day, family advocates,
    business leaders and key legislators across the nation will
    hold news events in 44 states highlighting the success of
    President Clinton�s Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), said
    Clinton/Gore Campaign Manager Peter S. Knight.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>September 24 marks the fourth anniversary of Bob Dole�s
    vote to sustain then-President George Bush�s veto of the Family
    and Medical Leave Act. The Act enables workers to take unpaid
    leave to care for a family member without fear of losing their
    jobs.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton, Vice President Gore, First Lady
    Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Tipper Gore will kick-off these
    nationwide efforts at events in New Jersey, Louisiana,
    Connecticut and Tennessee, respectively, on the 24th. �No other
    piece of legislation has had a more immediate impact on the
    American family�s ability to stay together in times of critical
    need. President Clinton�s decisive leadership cut through the
    special interest politicking that had stalled earlier efforts,
    and, with passage of the Act, he demonstrated that what�s good
    for the American family is good for business,� said
    Knight.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Knight talked about other elements of President
    Clinton�s strong pro-family record, citing the President�s
    expansion of the Earned Income Tax credit, which provides tax
    relief for 15 million working families; signing into law the
    first increase in the minimum wage in five years; and
    investment in education through the Goals 2000 initiative.
    Also, in addition to making the FMLA the first piece of
    legislation the President signed upon taking office in 1992,
    President Clinton recently proposed an expansion of the
    Act.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>In the face of clear evidence that the FMLA has not
    negatively impacted businesses but has helped millions of
    working Americans attend to family emergencies, and, in
    general, balance the competing demands of work and family, Bob
    Dole continues to speak out against family and medical leave,
    most recently on September 7th in a campaign speech.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Some of the events and participants include a roundtable
    at Mile High Medical Child Care Center in Colorado featuring
    Gail Schoettler who is the Colorado Lt. Governor and Diana
    DeGette who is a Colorado candidate. In Florida, there will be
    a news conference at Wackenhutt Security Firm in West Palm
    Beach with Lawton Chiles, who is the Governor of Florida. In
    Minnesota, Ellen Anderson, Jane Ranum, Carol Flynn, Linda
    Berglin, Karen Clark, and Donna Robertson, who are current or
    former state legislators, will participate in a news conference
    at the State Capitol. Each event will feature people who have
    been affected by the FMLA.</tt></p>
