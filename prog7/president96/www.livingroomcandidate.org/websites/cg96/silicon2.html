<P>CLINTON/GORE RECEIVES KEY ENDORSEMENT 

FROM SILICON VALLEY BUSINESS LEADERS



<P>Over 75 Executives Announce Support for President and Vice President



<P>San Jose, CA-Over 75 business leaders from the largest and fastest-growing high technology companies, as well as several of the most influential venture capitalists in the Silicon Valley and throughout California, today announced their endorsement of President Clinton and Vice President Gore.



<P>The President and Vice President telephoned the group, hosted at Adobe Systems Inc. by the company’s President, Chuck Geschke, and CEO John Warnock.  San Jose Mayor Susan Hammer, Apple Computer’s founder Stephen Jobs and 17 high technology leaders were on hand at Adobe for the telephone call.



<P>President Clinton has expanded his support in Silicon Valley since taking office, the executives said, because his policies look toward the future with an understanding of what it takes to succeed in the new high-tech global economy.

	

<P>“When it comes to creating jobs, deficit reduction, and investments in technology and education, Clinton and Gore have shown remarkable leadership” said John Doerr of Kleiner, Perkins & Byers, one of the nation’s leading venture funds.



<P>“The President appreciates that today’s business is conducted in an international forum and he is helping us compete internationally,” Adobe’s Warnock said.



<P>For the Silicon Valley/ San Jose area, investments in research, technology and education, making development of the “Information Superhighway” and opening world markets point to extraordinary job growth and a better prepared 21st century workforce.



<P>“President Clinton understands the importance of Silicon Valley to the nation’s economic vitality,” said San Jose Mayor Susan Hammer.  “Nearly 41,000 jobs have been created here in the last two years.  Because of President Clinton, Silicon Valley businesses are more competitive than ever before in the global marketplace.”



<P>Dr. Yvette Prado, Vice President of Silicon Graphics said Clinton “helped transform our schools with information-age technology.  I believe that the Clinton/Gore team will continue to invest in America’s future and prepare our children for the 21st century.”



<P>About one third of the endorsers are executives working in the new and emerging high technology sectors growing around the Internet and World Wide Web -- industries created since the election of Clinton and Gore in 1992



<P>A complete list of endorsers is attached.
