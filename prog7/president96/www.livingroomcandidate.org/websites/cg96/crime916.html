    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    September 16, 1996</tt>
    <p><tt>STATEMENT BY JOE LOCKHART<br>
    NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY</tt></p>
    <p><tt>When it comes to fighting crime, Bob Dole is running on
    empty.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>From his one-liners to his policy prescriptions, Bob
    Dole�s performance today might just be a violation of copyright
    law. Virtually all of the proposals Candidate Dole outlined
    today have already been implemented by the Clinton
    Administration -- over the active opposition of Senator Dole.
    Bob Dole even resorted to stealing one-liners from the
    President. A September 28, 1992 press release from the
    Clinton/Gore campaign included the following line: "... when it
    comes to fighting crime, George Bush talks like Clint Eastwood,
    but his record looks like Barney Fife."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Candidate Dole said today that he wants to cut youth
    drug use by 50 percent. But Senator Dole voted to cut the
    President�s "Safe and Drug Free Schools" initiative by 50
    percent. Candidate Dole said he wanted to provide more funding
    for prison construction. But Senator Dole voted against the
    President�s 1994 Crime Bill which provided $7.9 billion for new
    prisons. Candidate Dole said he wants to establish an instant
    computer check to prevent criminals from illegally buying guns.
    But Senator Dole led the Republican fight against the Brady
    Bill which provides funds for a national Instant Check system.
    In short, when Bob Dole had a chance to act, he chose to "just
    say no."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>They say that imitation is the highest form of flattery
    -- but we wish Bob Dole had decided to support the President�s
    anti-crime agenda when he was in office and could actually do
    something about it.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Not only did the national Fraternal Order of Police
    endorse the President�s crime fighting initiatives today, so
    did Bob Dole.</tt></p>
