              Idaho is the country�s 21st largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $730 million in
              agricultural exports abroad or 1.7% of the U.S. total
              in 1994 (latest year available for Department of
              Agriculture state export data). The largest export
              categories, vegetables and wheat, accounted for over
              65 percent of Idaho�s agricultural exports in 1994.
              Given the 22 percent increase in total U.S.
              agriculture exports in 1995, agriculture exports from
              Idaho in 1995 will likely range between $850 million
              and $900 million.
