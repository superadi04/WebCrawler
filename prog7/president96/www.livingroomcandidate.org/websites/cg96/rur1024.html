    <p><tt>Washington, D.C. -- The Clinton/Gore campaign today
    announced the formation of "Rural Citizens for Clinton/Gore �96
    Committee." With twelve days until the Presidential election,
    this grass roots organization will mobilize the more than 61
    million rural Americans to support the re-election of President
    Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Comprised of farmers, national and local officials, and
    other rural citizens, this group will continue to communicate
    the improvements of rural America under the Clinton
    Administration In addition, members will be conducting
    Clinton/Gore get-out-the-vote activities in their respective
    states.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>E. (Kika) de la Garza, honorary national co-chair of the
    "Rural Citizens for Clinton/Gore �96 Committee" and a U.S.
    Congressman from Texas stated, "Thanks to the President�s
    policies, problems in rural America are being addressed. Net
    farm income is up, small town manufacturing jobs are up, and
    people are migrating back to rural places rather than leaving.
    It is no surprise that rural America is coming together to
    support the President�s re-election."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Honorary national co-chair Dan Glickman added, "Rural
    Americans are rallying behind President Clinton because they
    know that the President has the vision and a plan that will
    lead rural America to a more prosperous and secure 21st
    Century."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The formation of the "Rural Citizens for Clinton/Gore
    �96 Committee" follows upon the recent personal endorsement by
    eighteen state Commissioners and Secretaries of Agriculture of
    the re-election of President Clinton and Vice President
    Gore.</tt></p>
