    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    September 1, 1996</tt></p>
    <p><tt>STATEMENT BY JOE LOCKHART<br>
    NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole is stuck in the old Washington way of
    "either/or" politics: choosing between interdiction and
    prevention as a solution to the drug war. It�s a false choice.
    President Clinton has submitted the largest drug budget ever
    that unites enforcement, interdiction and treatment to combat
    drug abuse. The President has continued to use the National
    Guard to help police our borders — and he has increased the
    number of Border Patrol agents on the Southwest border by over
    40 percent.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The National Guard is doing its job. Unfortunately, the
    Dole-Gingrich Congress has not. Dole and Gingrich cut the
    President�s overall drug fighting budget for this year by
    nearly $800 million. Dole and Gingrich voted against the
    President�s expansion of the Safe and Drug Free Schools program
    in 1994. And one of their first actions in 1995 was to cut
    funding for the Safe and Drug Free Schools initiative by 50
    percent. Dole and Gingrich also voted against the President�s
    1994 Anti-Crime bill — which expanded the death penalty for
    drug kingpins, instituted a tough "three strikes and you�re
    out" sentence for the most dangerous career criminals and
    provided for drug courts and expanded drug testing.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>More troubling than past actions, Senator Bob Dole�s
    economic plan will include 40 percent across-the-board cuts in
    all law enforcement programs, including border
    patrols.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton has a strong record when it comes to
    fighting the war on drugs. The President elevated the Drug Czar
    to a Cabinet-level position and appointed four-star General
    Barry McCaffrey — the first Drug Czar with a drug interdiction
    background — to lead the fight against drugs. Year-in and
    year-out, the President has proposed the largest anti-drug
    budgets ever. Under the Clinton Budget now before Congress, the
    DEA would grow by 18% in one year and 116 new DEA agents would
    be added.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>In his Thursday night convention speech, the President
    challenged Congress to immediately pass his national anti-drug
    budget. If Bob Dole is serious about fighting the war on drugs,
    he should convince his Republican colleagues in Congress to
    take up the President�s challenge and immediately pass the
    President�s supplemental request for fighting drugs in
    America.</tt></p>
