  <blockquote>
    <a name="dh" id="dh"></a><b>David Hermelin — Detroit,
    MI</b><br>
    “In this election year, I want to voice my support for
    President Clinton. I feel strongly that Bill Clinton has been
    not only a friend to Israel, but a President who has exhibited
    strong leadership on issues that are important to me as an
    American Jew. During his first term, President Clinton has not
    backed down from tackling difficult issues. For proof of
    President Clinton�s commitment, one need only look at his
    record.
    <p>“President Clinton has been a strong ally to Israel in the
    ongoing struggle for peace in the Middle East. Under President
    Clinton, the United States has been a facilitator and active
    mediator in the peace process. President Clinton helped to
    forge the agreement that led to the Israel-Palestinian
    Declaration of Principles in 1993, as well as the Interim
    Agreement on Palestinian self-rule in 1995. Both of these
    agreements were signed at the White House. President Clinton
    was also instrumental in clearing the way for the signing of a
    formal peace treaty between Jordan and Israel in 1994. With the
    support of the United States, these countries have made
    progress toward establishing a lasting peace. Contrary to
    President Clinton�s strong support of Israel, Bob Dole has
    repeatedly failed to stand up to Middle East dictators that
    have threatened Israel and he has called upon Israel to free
    terrorists that sponsored attacks on Israeli citizens.</p>
    <p>“President Clinton is also committed to establishing peace
    within the borders of the United States. President Clinton
    stood up to the National Rifle Association (NRA) and did not
    back down from the divisive issue of gun control. President
    Clinton is the first President to take on the NRA. As a result
    of President Clinton�s actions, more than 60,000 fugitives,
    felons and stalkers have been prevented from buying handguns.
    Bob Dole, on the other hand, has consistently opposed measures
    to establish reasonable limitations on gun ownership. President
    Clinton has also taken action to make our streets safer by
    adding funds for 100,000 police officers, signing the Brady
    Bill, and enacting the Assault Weapons Ban.</p>
    <p>“President Clinton has also been strong on the issue of
    affirmative action. Following the 1994 elections, when the
    Republicans gained control of both the House of Representatives
    and the Senate, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and then Senate
    Majority Leader Bob Dole joined California Governor Pete Wilson
    in an assault on affirmative action. President Clinton, holding
    firm to his beliefs that the American Dream must be restored to
    everyone and that common ground must be found among diversity,
    proposed that affirmative action should be mended instead of
    ended. By working hard to reach common ground on this issue,
    the President believes that there will be a day when racial and
    sexual discrimination will cease to be a problem in our
    society. However, until that day, I believe that the President
    is realistic in his belief that steps must continue to be taken
    to address the issue.</p>
    <p>“During his first term as President, Bill Clinton has also
    demonstrated a strong commitment to providing educational
    opportunities for young people. The President signed into law a
    number of bills to assist students in getting an education. For
    example, the President signed: the Student Loan Reform Act to
    make college affordable for millions of students; the
    School-to-Work Opportunities Act to provide students with
    work-based learning and new pathways from high school to good
    jobs and post-secondary education; and the Improving America�s
    Schools Act to give schools greater flexibility to use federal
    aid and to develop effective teaching innovations to held
    economically disadvantaged students achieve their full
    potential. In addition, the President challenged Congress to
    make $10,000 of college tuition tax deductible each year, to
    provide $1,000 for merit scholarships for the top 5% of all
    high school graduates, and to expand Pell Grants.</p>
    <p>“Looking at the record it is easy to see why President has
    been such a success. He has exhibited a strong commitment to
    leadership on issues like security and education that are key
    to the future of the United States. That is why I will be
    voting for President Clinton in November.” <a name="mg" id=
    "mg"></a></p>
    <p><b>Rabbi Menachem Genack</b><br>
    “Israel�s close relationship with the United States, the
    world�s sole superpower, is amongst its most important
    strategic assets. That relationship has been enhanced and
    deepened to an unprecedented degree during the Clinton
    administration. President Clinton has often told the story of
    his pledge to his dying pastor, never to hurt Israel. That is a
    pledge he has more than kept.</p>
    <p>“The burgeoning growth in the Israel economy has in large
    measure been due to the Clinton administration�s effort to
    aggressively open up markets that were hitherto closed to
    Israel. When the Orthodox Union met with Ambassador Jeffery
    Lang, the Deputy US Trade Representative, he stated that the
    administration�s efforts reflected President Clinton�s view
    that this was not only a political and economic issue, but also
    a moral one.</p>
    <p>“But for President Clinton�s insistence, foreign aid to
    Israel, which currently exceeds 3 billion dollars, would
    certainly have been cut. In contrast, Senator Dole was the
    leader in the Bush administration in the effort to cut foreign
    aid to Israel. In January 1990 Senator Dole stated, �And can�t
    my colleagues in Congress, who have forced the President to
    swallow a few huge earmarked aid programs (referring to Israel)
    stand up to domestic political pressure and resist the
    temptation to politicize foreign aid?� In April 1990, he stated
    it more egregiously, �It�s not sensitivity, it�s selfishness.
    There are a lot of people in this world who need help in
    addition to Israel.�</p>
    <p>“Given that America plays such a significant role in the
    security of Israel and remains Israel�s only reliable ally, a
    President�s instincts, not only stated policy relative to
    Israel, is critical. In times of crisis, instincts are what
    count. Bill Clinton�s instincts toward Israel and the Jewish
    people are warm and profoundly caring. It could be seen,
    irrespective of policy, in the depth of his feelings for his
    friend, Yitzchak Rabin. I saw it when I traveled to Israel with
    the President as part of his guest delegation for the signing
    of the peace treaty with Jordan. That affection was
    reciprocated in full measure by the people of Israel, who saw
    Bill Clinton as a genuine friend.</p>
    <p>“When the President spoke to the Knesset, his words were
    warm and reassuring. The President�s speech was succor to a
    people who have been traumatized by the murder of Nachson
    Waxman and the terrorist attack on the bus number 5 in Tel
    Aviv. In the audience that evening were Nachson�s parents to
    whom the President addressed words of consolation. His
    concluding words that America will stand with Israel always,
    were the most explicit, and clearly sincere commitment of
    American support for Israel and sensitivity for its security
    needs.</p>
    <p>“The paroxysm of press focus on Bill Clinton�s character is
    ironically out of sync with the reality. Bill Clinton is
    clearly a person who likes people. Public policy fascinates him
    because he cares about people and it affords him the
    opportunity to ameliorate their condition.</p>
    <p>“A friend of mine, Aaron Kinderlehrer, a New York lawyer,
    was in Bill Clinton�s law school class at Yale. He had then
    returned from studying at a yeshiva in Israel, yarmulke, beard
    and all. In those days, Yale was not always the most hospitable
    environment for an Orthodox Jew. But, Aaron remembers Bill
    Clinton, who was in his study group, as being warm, generous
    and welcoming. Bill Clinton�s generosity of spirit, tolerance
    and compassion are what characterize the man and his
    relationship to Israel.</p>
    <p>“President Clinton identifies with Israel�s dream of peace
    with security. We the Jewish people have always been imbued
    with hope, �hatikvah.� Though buffeted by history, we have
    never despaired of mankind, and remain optimistic, faithful to
    our dream and full of hope. That is a message and perspective
    that resonated with America and its leader, the man from Hope.”
    <a name="as" id="as"></a></p>
    <p><b>Rabbi Alexander M. Schindler</b><br>
    “During this election year the presidential candidates have
    asked us to determine if we are better off today than we were
    four years ago. Applying this question to the State of Israel
    and other issues close to my heart, the answer is a resounding
    yes. President Bill Clinton is the best political ally American
    Jews and Israel have ever had. During his first term, President
    Clinton has proved his dedication by standing by Israel for
    both peace and security.</p>
    <p>“For example, President Clinton worked hard during his first
    term to ensure that aid to Israel is maintained despite
    post-Cold War cutbacks in spending. According to President
    Clinton, it is in the interest of the United States to continue
    to support Israel. As a result of these actions, Israel is the
    largest recipient of aid from the United States. On the
    contrary, while in Congress, Bob Dole proposed a five percent
    reduction in aid to Israel and consistently voted against
    foreign aid.</p>
    <p>“In addition to financial assistance, President Clinton has
    provided personal assistance in fostering peace negotiations in
    the Middle East. Under President Clinton�s watch, the Israelis
    and Palestinians concluded their first ever peace agreement. In
    order to ensure that efforts toward peace continue, President
    Clinton organized the March 1996 Summit of Peacemakers in Egypt
    with 29 world and regional leaders to support the Middle East
    peace process and to counter terrorism.</p>
    <p>“In his first term, President Clinton has also shown he is
    committed to the social issues that are so important to the
    lives of Jews living in the United States. President Clinton
    signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which protects
    the rights of all Americans to practice their religion freely.
    In addition, President Clinton has emphasized the importance of
    education by expanding the Head Start program, signing
    important legislation like Goals 2000 and the School to Work
    Act, and linking classrooms to the Information Superhighway by
    the year 2000. The list goes on and on.</p>
    <p>“I must admit that I do not agree with all of President
    Clinton�s decisions on domestic issues. Recently, President
    Clinton signed a welfare reform bill that, I believe,
    compromised on some key issues. Nonetheless, while the bill is
    not perfect, it is far better than the prior versions he
    vetoed. It is a first decent step in the direction he will
    hopefully advance in his second term.</p>
    <p>“In sum, I fully support President Clinton in his reelection
    efforts. I hope that he will be for you - as he is for me - the
    candidate of choice.” <a name="sg" id="sg"></a></p>
    <p><b>Steve Grossman — Boston, MA</b><br>
    “On November 5, 1996, I will vote to re-elect President Bill
    Clinton. I will cast my vote in favor of President Clinton
    because he has been a great president for the United States and
    for Israel. There is little doubt that President Clinton has
    been a friend to Israel during his first term as president, and
    that he will continue to support Israel if he is
    re-elected.</p>
    <p>“During the past four years President Clinton has ensured
    that the United States is Israel�s largest donor. In 1995
    alone, the United States provided Israel with $3 billion in
    economic assistance. Amazingly, President Clinton has
    maintained this level of aid to Israel despite overall
    post-Cold War cutbacks in foreign aid.</p>
    <p>“President Clinton has also ensured that trade between the
    United States and Israel is strong. In fact, the United States
    is Israel�s largest trading partner. In 1995, trade between the
    United States and Israel topped $11.3 billion.</p>
    <p>“While the President�s commitment is strong, Senator Dole�s
    record proves that he is not a friend to Israel. In 1989, Bob
    Dole was one of only fifteen United States Senators to vote
    against $3 billion in foreign aid for Israel. Then in 1990,
    Dole proposed a five percent reduction in United States aid to
    Israel, saying that Israel should not be privileged. Combine
    this with the former Senator�s voting record against foreign
    aid, and one can easily see that if Bob Dole was elected
    president, Israel would not be a priority for him.</p>
    <p>“In addition to economic assistance, the President has stood
    by Israel in the peace process. President Clinton has lent
    diplomatic cooperation to the process, holding over a dozen
    meetings with Israeli Prime Ministers Rabin, Peres and
    Netanyahu. The fact that President Clinton has reached out to
    each of the Israeli Prime Ministers during the course of his
    first term emphasizes that his commitment to peace is not a
    result of his relationship with a particular Prime Minister,
    but of his relationship with Israel.</p>
    <p>“President Clinton has also proven his commitment to
    counter-terrorism measures. Among his recent actions, President
    Clinton co-hosted the Sharm el-Sheikh Summit of the Peacemakers
    to galvanize international support to fight terrorists attacks
    on Israel. In addition, the President was swift in providing
    $100 million in emergency counter-terrorism aid to Israel
    following terrorists attacks in February and March of 1996.</p>
    <p>“I am confident that, if given the opportunity to serve
    another term, President Clinton will continue to further
    relations with Israel by standing by as Israel takes risks for
    peace. Israel has found a friend and ally in President Clinton
    and I intend to do all that I can to ensure this relationship
    continues well into the future. I urge all those who care for
    Israel as I do to strongly consider doing the same.” <a name=

    <p><b>Stan Chesley — Cincinnati, OH</b><br>
    “In November I will cast my ballot to elect Bill Clinton to a
    second term as President of the United States. I can identify
    with President Clinton. During his first term, the President
    has shown dedication and commitment to the issues that matter
    most to me personally. In addition, President Clinton has
    demonstrated that he is able to get results by being an
    effective advocate and mediator.</p>
    <p>“Under President Clinton, the United States has demonstrated
    its commitment in the international fight for freedom and
    peace. Since his election in 1992, President Clinton has been
    active in mediating peace negotiations in the Middle East,
    reducing the overall numbers of nuclear missiles throughout the
    world, and opening previously closed markets to American
    products.</p>
    <p>“President Clinton has been instrumental in mediating
    agreements among political leaders in the Middle East. During
    his first term, President Clinton has held over a dozen
    meetings with Israeli Prime Ministers Rabin, Peres, and
    Netanyahu. In fact, it was President Clinton�s skills as a
    mediator that helped to forge the agreements that led to the
    Israel-Palestinian Declaration of Principles in September of
    1993, as well as the Interim Agreement on Palestinian self-rule
    in September of 1995. In addition, President Clinton helped to
    clear the way to the signing of a formal peace treaty between
    Jordan and Israel in October of 1994. As a result of the
    President�s participation, these countries have made
    substantial progress in establishing peace.</p>
    <p>“President Clinton has been an advocate for ending
    terrorism. The President co-hosted the Sharm el-Sheikh Summit
    of the Peacemakers to galvanize international support to fight
    terrorist attacks on Israel. In addition, the President signed
    the US-Israel Counter-Terrorism Accord to facilitate greater
    counter-terrorism aid to Israel. The President has backed his
    actions in this arena by providing $100 million in emergency
    counter-terrorism aid to Israel in the immediate aftermath of
    terrorist attacks as recently as February and March of
    1996.</p>
    <p>“Sadly, as the recent fighting in Israel shows, the road to
    peace is not a smooth one. In keeping with his role as
    mediator, President Clinton did not hesitate to bring together
    the leaders during a time of crisis. The President�s dedication
    to this role should not be taken for granted. I fear to ask
    what would happen to the fragile peace agreements if President
    Clinton were not in office.” <a name="ll" id="ll"></a></p>
    <p><b>Lynn Lyss — St. Louis, MO</b><br>
    “As November approaches, I am faced with the question of which
    candidate to vote for. Actually, the decision is an easy one
    for me. I will cast my vote for President Bill Clinton.
    President Clinton has a strong record on issues of importance
    to me: support for woman and families and support for the State
    of Israel.</p>
    <p>“President Clinton has done his best to ensure that women�s
    voices are heard at every level of government. The President
    has appointed more women to his administration than any other
    president in history. Today the administration is 40 percent
    women. For the first time in history women were appointed to
    high level posts such as Attorney General, Chair of the Council
    of Economic Advisors, Secretary of Energy, Office of Management
    and Budget Director, and White House Deputy Chief of Staff.
    President Clinton has also appointed a record number of women
    to the federal bench.</p>
    <p>“In addition to appointing women to important positions, the
    President has established a number of offices devoted to
    improving the lives of women. The President created the White
    House Office for Women�s Initiatives and Outreach, the
    Department of Justice�s Office for Violence Against Women, as
    well as the Interagency Council on Women�s Business Enterprise.
    The creation of these offices enable women to reach their
    fullest potential as individuals and as members of our
    society.</p>
    <p>“In recognizing that women are an essential part of the
    workforce, the President also has not failed to take into
    account the responsibilities that parents have to their
    families. In order to help parents meet these responsibilities,
    the President proposed an employee choice flex-time initiative
    that will allow workers to arrange with their employers to work
    overtime in exchange for up to 80 hours of paid time off.
    President Clinton also signed the Family and Medical Leave Act
    to enable workers to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to
    care for a family member without fear of losing their jobs. On
    the other hand, Bob Dole repeatedly voted to block the Family
    and Medical Leave Act and was one of 27 senators to vote
    against final passage of the bill.</p>
    <p>“President Clinton stands by a woman�s right to choose and
    believes abortions should be safe, legal, and rare. Like most
    of us, the President would not encourage a woman to have an
    abortion, and realizes that choosing to have an abortion is not
    an easy decision for any woman. The President has been a leader
    in protecting a woman�s right to choose. President Clinton
    signed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. This act
    confronts violence and intimidation against women and their
    doctors and ensures clinic safety by establishing civil and
    criminal penalties for people who use force to block access to
    clinics.</p>
    <p>“No President has been a better friend to Israel than Bill
    Clinton. He has consistently supported foreign aid to Israel.
    According to the President, United States assistance to Israel
    furthers U.S. national security interests. President Clinton is
    committed to fostering peace and stability in the Middle East.
    If elected to a second term, President Clinton will continue to
    stand by Israel as it takes risks for peace and will continue
    to facilitate peace negotiations between Israel and its Arab
    neighbors.</p>
    <p>“As the record shows, by voting for Bill Clinton I will be
    voting for a man who understands and supports the issues that
    are important to me.” <a name="jt" id="jt"></a></p>
    <p><b>Joel Tauber — Detroit, MI</b><br>
    “In November I will be voting for President Bill Clinton. My
    decision is based upon President Clinton�s strong leadership
    qualities. I firmly believe in the importance of leadership,
    regarding both domestic issues here in the United States and
    international issues, especially policy towards Israel. During
    his first term, President Clinton has more than demonstrated
    that he is a strong leader by not backing away from tough
    issues.</p>
    <p>“When it came time to address the pressing issue of deficit
    reduction, President Clinton made the difficult decision to
    defer offering a middle class tax cut in exchange for a
    realistic proposal to reduce the deficit. It is also worth
    mentioning that not one Republican voted for the President�s
    deficit reduction bill. According to the Republicans, the
    President�s bill would destroy the economy of the United
    States. But the naysayers were wrong, as evidenced by the fact
    that inflation is the lowest it has been since the Kennedy
    years, and that the President has created more than 10.5
    million jobs since he took office. As a result of President
    Clinton�s leadership, the economy has experienced the fastest
    economic growth rate since the 1920�s.</p>
    <p>“President Clinton has been tireless in striving for better,
    safer public schools and improved college opportunities. The
    President has signed legislation to allow more choice within
    the public school system, to keep drugs and guns out of schools
    and to improve and toughen academic standards in public
    schools. In addition, in order to make college education more
    affordable, President Clinton has proposed college education
    tax credits to help families and created the Direct Lending
    Program, which will make student loans more accessible and cost
    effective. In contrast, Bob Dole has repeatedly said no to
    efforts to improve and invest in education. Bob Dole voted
    against important education programs such as Head Start, Public
    School Choice, the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program, and
    Direct Student Lending.</p>
    <p>“President Clinton has also demonstrated his leadership by
    protecting democratic governments in other countries. In Haiti,
    for example, President Clinton thought that restoring the
    legitimately elected President Aristide and a democratic system
    for his succession was the right thing to do. The President
    wanted to do his part to improve the lives of the Haitians, so
    he took a tough stand in support of President Aristide.</p>
    <p>“Perhaps the most significant example of President Clinton�s
    leadership is his involvement in the peace process in the
    Middle East. Following the most recent Israeli-Palestinian
    conflict, the President was swift to get the parties around the
    table in order to talk about restoring the peace process. No
    one person has the power to instantly end the timeless struggle
    and restore peace in the Middle East after one meeting.
    President Clinton acknowledges this reality and has
    consistently demonstrated his ongoing commitment to
    establishing peace.</p>
    <p>“Through his actions involving both domestic issues and
    international concerns, President Clinton exhibits the strength
    and leadership that are so essential. Therefore, I have no
    doubt that Bill Clinton will continue to succeed in his second
    term, as he has in his first.” <a name="gk" id="gk"></a></p>
    <p><b>Gerda W. Klein — Scottsdale, AZ</b><br>
    “During this, the 1996 Presidential Campaign, I would like to
    add my voice to that of so many caring Americans, to express my
    positive feelings toward President Clinton and the Democratic
    Party. I, who have enjoyed the freedom this country has offered
    me and my family for the past 50 years, find that President
    Clinton and Vice President Gore -- along with the party they
    represent -- embody all that is good and right about the
    American way.</p>
    <p>“Whenever I travel throughout this country -- and often
    beyond its borders -- I find to my delight that a great
    majority of people express their satisfaction and wholehearted
    support of President Clinton, both as to his domestic and
    foreign policies. Beyond this country�s borders, these feelings
    came into sharper focus recently during a trip to Canada, where
    major newspapers had come out with editorials laudatory of the
    Administration. I also found that my friends there were in full
    accord with the course to which this country is committed and
    appear to take it as an accomplished fact that President
    Clinton will lead this country for another four-year term. Many
    of those sentiments were echoed in two other countries, South
    Africa and Brazil, which I have visited in recent times. Above
    all, I find it significant that the Administration is
    responding quickly and resolutely in response to the multitude
    of challenges with which it is confronted on a daily basis.</p>
    <p>“On a personal level, I am greatly comforted by the weight
    President Clinton and his administration have thrown behind the
    maintenance and preservation of the Mid-east peace process that
    showed so much promise when it was initiated two years ago.
    President Clinton has shown a rare depth of understanding and
    compassion for the needs of a broad cross-section of the
    American people, in particular the hungry and homeless with
    whom I can identify so well. One of my greatest treasures and
    cause of immense pride is my American citizenship and all the
    privileges to which it entitles me. It is a matter which I can
    never take lightly.</p>
    <p>“In that connection, I am reminded of a high school lecture
    on the Holocaust which I gave some years ago. In the course of
    it, one of the students raised his hand and wanted to know why
    I didn�t write my congressman when all those events were caused
    by Hitler. How blessed we are to live in a country that creates
    a climate of unquestioned freedom!</p>
    <p>“My very best wishes go to President Clinton and Vice
    President Gore during this crucial election year and
    beyond.”</p>
