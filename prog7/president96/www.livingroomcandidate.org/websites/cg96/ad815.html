<P>
<BR>
	<P>Today, August 15, 1996, the Clinton/Gore ‘96 campaign begins running a new advertisement entitled "Real Ticket".  The text of the ad follows:


<i><P>Real Ticket

<P>The Oval Office.

<P>If it were Bob Dole sitting here...

<P>He would have already cut Medicare $270 billion dollars.

<P>Toxic polluters off the hook.  

<P>No to the Brady Bill...60,000 criminals allowed to buy handguns.  

<P>Slashed education.

<P>President Clinton stood firm and defended our values. 

<P>But next year, if  Newt Gingrich controls Congress and his partner, Bob Dole, enters the Oval Office, they’ll be nobody there to stop them.</i>

<P>(President Clinton. Protecting our values.)

<P>VHS and Beta copies of the ad are available at Clinton/Gore ‘96 headquarters.  Please call the press office at 202/496-1037.
