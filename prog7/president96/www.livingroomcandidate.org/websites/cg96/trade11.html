              Florida is the country�s 14th largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $1.0 billion in
              agricultural exports abroad or 2.3% of the U.S. total
              in 1994 (latest year available for Department of
              Agriculture state export data). The largest export
              category, fruit, accounted for more than 50 percent
              of Florida�s agricultural exports during 1994. Given
              the 22 percent increase in total U.S. agriculture
              exports in 1995, agriculture exports from Florida in
              1995 will likely range between $1.1 billion and $1.3
              billion.
