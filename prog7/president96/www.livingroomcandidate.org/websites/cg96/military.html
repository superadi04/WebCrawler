    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    October 10, 1996</tt>
    <p><tt><b>MORE THAN 100 FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERTS
    PERSONALLY ENDORSE PRESIDENT CLINTON�S FOREIGN POLICY AND HIS
    RE-ELECTION</b></tt></p>
    <p><tt>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Expressing support for President
    Clinton�s foreign and defense policies, more than 100 former
    national security officials -- including retired Ambassadors,
    military flag officers, and senior State Department, Pentagon,
    and Presidential advisers -- today personally endorsed
    President Clinton and Vice President Gore.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The list includes officials who served under Republican
    and Democratic administrations; flag officers from the Army,
    Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy; and diplomats with service
    in virtually all parts of the world.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Explaining why they are supporting President Clinton
    over Bob Dole they wrote, "We salute President Clinton for
    resisting voices that encourage the United States to turn
    toward isolationism, to raise protectionist barriers, or to
    abdicate our global responsibilities. We praise the President�s
    willingness to use U.S. military power effectively, as he has
    done in Iraq, Bosnia, Haiti, the Taiwan Strait and elsewhere.
    We applaud his opposition to irresponsible reductions in
    American military readiness, diplomatic effectiveness, and
    intelligence capabilities. We commend his diligent efforts to
    lead America and the world to a more peaceful and secure 21st
    century."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The national security professionals, representing
    decades of experience on every aspect of international affairs,
    said in the written statement, "We support President Bill
    Clinton and Vice President Al Gore as the candidates in 1996
    best able to provide that leadership and vision."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Clinton/Gore �96 Campaign Manager Peter S. Knight
    remarked, "President Clinton is working hard to build a more
    peaceful, prosperous and secure future for all Americans, and
    this letter from these distinguished national security
    officials shows that we are on the right track."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Among those signing the statement were former arms
    control negotiator Ambassador-at-large Paul Nitze, former Chief
    of Naval Operations Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, former Secretary of
    State Cyrus Vance, former Secretary of Defense Harold Brown,

      <p><tt><b>Statement of National Security and Defense Experts
      Personally Endorsing President Clinton and Vice President
      Gore<br>
      October 10, 1996</b></tt></p>
      <p><tt><b>The Imperative of U.S. Leadership</b></tt></p>
    </center>
    <p><tt>The post-Cold War era presents the United States with
    national security opportunities, challenges, and dangers that
    demand strong leadership and clear vision for a much changed
    world. As national security professionals, representing decades
    of experience on every aspect of international affairs, we
    support President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore as
    the candidates in 1996 best able to provide that leadership and
    vision.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The Clinton Administration has produced impressive
    national security accomplishments: breakthroughs for peace in
    the Mideast, Bosnia, Haiti, Northern Ireland, and South Africa;
    a sound defense program that has preserved the readiness of our
    forces while reshaping our military for the 21st century;
    ratification of the START II nuclear arms control treaty and
    the end to Russian nuclear missiles being pointed at American
    targets; securing agreements to remove all nuclear weapons from
    the former Soviet states of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus;
    the freezing of the North Korean nuclear weapons program and
    other steps to enhance security in East Asia; attaining
    overwhelming adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban
    Treaty and indefinite extension of the Nuclear Nonproliferation
    Treaty; convictions of the World Trade Center bombers and
    sanctions against states that support terrorism; enactment of
    landmark accords to lower foreign trade barriers, boost
    American exports, and create jobs; bold steps to prevent a
    destabilizing crisis in Mexico; important efforts to protect
    the global environment; and initiatives to relieve suffering,
    encourage democracy, and advance human rights abroad.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>We believe strong American leadership abroad remains
    essential after the Cold War. We salute President Clinton for
    resisting voices that encourage the United States to turn
    toward isolationism, to raise protectionist barriers, or to
    abdicate our global responsibilities. We praise the President�s
    willingness to use U.S. military power effectively, as he has
    done in Iraq, Bosnia, Haiti, the Taiwan Strait and elsewhere.
    We applaud his opposition to irresponsible reductions in
    American military readiness, diplomatic effectiveness, and
    intelligence capabilities. We commend his diligent efforts to
    lead America and the world to a more peaceful and secure 21st
    century.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>National security remains the most important aspect of a
    president�s job. That is why we are supporting President Bill
    Clinton to remain our Commander-in-Chief.</tt></p>
