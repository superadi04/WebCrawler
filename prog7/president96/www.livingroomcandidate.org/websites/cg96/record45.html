            combined rate of unemployment, inflation, and mortgage
            rates since 1968. Consumer confidence is at its highest

            time in a decade, and homeownership is at a 15-year
            high.

            fewer people are on welfare. In addition, tougher child

            an increase of 31% since FY 1992.

            violence.
