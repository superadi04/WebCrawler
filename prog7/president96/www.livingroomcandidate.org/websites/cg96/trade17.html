              Mississippi is the country�s 23rd largest
              agricultural exporting state, shipping $580 million
              in agricultural exports abroad or 1.3% of the U.S.
              total in 1994 (latest year available for Department
              of Agriculture state export data). The largest export
              categories, cotton, soybeans, and poultry, accounted
              for over 80 percent of Mississippi�s agricultural
              exports in 1994. Given the 22 percent increase in
              total U.S. agriculture exports in 1995, agriculture
              exports from Mississippi in 1995 will likely range
              between $675 million and $725 million.
