    <p><tt>PRESS RELEASE<br>
    September 8, 1996</tt></p>
    <center>
      <tt>PRESIDENT CLINTON REAFFIRMS LONGSTANDING COMMITMENT TO
      QUALITY HEALTH CARE</tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>President Clinton has reaffirmed his longstanding
    commitment to quality health care. Recognizing that pressures
    on America�s health plans and health providers at times could
    have unintended effects on quality of care, President Clinton
    announced initiatives that would provide important patient
    protections. President Clinton�s speech in Sunrise, Florida
    announced the following initiatives:</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton endorsed bipartisan legislation that
    would prohibit health plans from restricting medical
    communications between health care providers and their
    patients. President Clinton also announced his support for the
    extension of this "anti-gag rule" to Medicare plans.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton reiterated his support for bipartisan
    legislation that would require health plans to pay for 48 hours
    of post-partum care for new mothers and their babies. In their
    speeches during the Democratic National Convention, both
    President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
    endorsed this "48-hour rule."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton signed an executive order to create
    the Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in
    the Health Care Industry. This commission will recommend public
    and private mechanisms to ensure quality health care in
    America�s evolving health care delivery systems. It will be
    co-chaired by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and
    the Secretary of Labor, and its final report will be reviewed
    by the Vice President before submission to the President. Its
    membership will include health care consumers, providers,
    insurers, and purchasers, and other experts in quality health
    care.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"These policies will go a long way towards protecting
    health care consumers and will continue moving health care
    policy for all Americans into the 21st century," said Steve
    Gleason, the Campaign�s Senior Health Policy Advisor.</tt></p>
