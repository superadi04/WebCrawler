              Colorado is the country�s 18th largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $803 million in
              agricultural exports abroad or 1.8% of the U.S. total
              in 1994 (latest year available for Department of
              Agriculture state export data). The largest export
              categories, Live Animals and Meat (excluding
              poultry), Wheat, Hides & Skins, and Feed Grains,
              accounted for 74 percent of Colorado�s agricultural
              exports in 1994. Given the 22 percent increase in
              total U.S. agriculture exports in 1995, agriculture
              exports from the state of Colorado in 1995 will
              likely range between $950 million and $1.0 billion.
