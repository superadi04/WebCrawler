              Delaware is the country�s 39th largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $81 million in agricultural
              exports abroad in 1994 (latest year available for
              Department of Agriculture state export data).
              Delaware�s largest agriculture export category,
              poultry, accounted for nearly 70 percent of
              Delaware�s agricultural exports in 1994. Given the 22
              percent increase in total U.S. agriculture exports in
              1995, agriculture exports from Delaware in 1995 will
              likely range between $90 million and $110 million.
