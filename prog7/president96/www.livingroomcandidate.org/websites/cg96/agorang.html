    September 28, 1996</tt></p>

      <tt><b>PRESIDENT CLINTON SUPPORTS THE FAMILIES OF<br>
      VIETNAM VETERANS EXPOSED TO AGENT ORANGE</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>In a ceremony at the White House this week, President
    Clinton signed legislation to provide relief to the children of
    Vietnam veterans exposed to the defoliant Agent
    Orange.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"I am very, very proud that this legislation will
    protect the families of Vietnam veterans who were exposed to
    Agent Orange," President Clinton said in his Rose Garden
    remarks. "Far too many of these brave soldiers have suffered
    illness as a result of their service, and now we know that, for
    many of them, the health effects were also passed along to
    their children. That is more than anyone can ask in terms of
    service to the nation."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The VA-HUD Appropriations Act includes provisions to
    provide a monthly allowance, lifetime health care benefits, and
    vocational training for the children of Vietnam veterans born
    with spina bifida. President Clinton proposed the legislation
    to Congress last August.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The bill was supported by a wide range of veterans�
    groups, including the Vietnam Veterans of America, the Veterans
    of Foreign Wars, the American Legion, AMVETS, and the Disabled
    American Veterans.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"This landmark legislation is the first time in history
    that children of veterans will be compensated for injuries
    resulting from their parents� military service," said Tom
    Keefe, the Director of Veterans Outreach at Clinton/Gore �96.
    "It is a continuation of President Clinton�s record as a
    champion for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange. When he
    came to office, only three diseases were presumed to be linked
    to Agent Orange exposure. President Clinton added six more,
    including Hodgkin�s disease and prostrate cancer."<br></tt></p>
