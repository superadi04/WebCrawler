    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    September 24, 1996</tt>
    <p><tt>TRANSCRIPT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON�S FREE AIR TIME REMARKS
    ON THE FOX NETWORK</tt></p>
    <p><tt>QUESTION: What ONE single accomplishment is MOST
    important to you to achieve in the next four years?</tt></p>
    <p><tt>PRESIDENT CLINTON: My most important goal is to give all
    our children the opportunity to live out the American
    Dream.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>That starts with education, and opening the doors to
    college, so that all Americans have the tools to make the most
    of their lives. We�ve already expanded scholarships and student
    loans and lowered their costs. Now we should make the first two
    years of college as universal as high school, by offering a
    $1,500 tax cut for those years, and up to a $10,000 tax
    deduction for any college tuition, and expanded IRAs so parents
    can save for college.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Creating opportunity also means protecting our children
    -- so they can grow up healthy and strong. That�s why we�re
    using tough laws like the anti-racketeering statute to fight
    gangs, strengthening school anti-drug programs, and banning
    tobacco ads aimed at children.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Opportunity through education. Stronger, safer families.
    That�s the way to build a bridge to the 21st century, and give
    every child a chance at the American dream.</tt></p>
