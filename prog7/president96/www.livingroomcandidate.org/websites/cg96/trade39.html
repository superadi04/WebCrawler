              New Jersey is the country�s 37th largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $123 million in
              agricultural exports abroad in 1994 (latest year
              available for Department of Agriculture state export
              data). New Jersey�s largest agriculture export
              category, miscellaneous products (mainly
              confectionery, nursery and greenhouse, essential
              oils, beverages, and other miscellaneous animal and
              vegetable products), accounted for nearly 65 percent
              of New Jersey�s agricultural exports in 1994. Given
              the 22 percent increase in total U.S. agriculture
              exports in 1995, agriculture exports from New Jersey
              in 1995 will likely range between $140 million and
              $160 million.
