  <blockquote>
    <p>October 1, 1996</p>
    <p>Dear Colleague:</p>
    <p>This letter to you and other fellow scientists is prompted
    by our deep concern over what is at stake in the current
    presidential election campaign for the scientific community and
    our future capacity to serve the nation.</p>
    <p>The Clinton/Gore Administration has established a clear
    record of support ing research, education, and the environment
    while greatly reducing the deficit. They have articulated the
    importance of science and technology investments for our
    nation's future where knowledge is the key resource. That
    commitment will be critical for sustaining the strength and
    vigor of our research enterprise while the difficult job of
    budget balancing is completed.</p>
    <p>Many of us are deeply disappointed by Senator Dole's
    proposed economic plan, one that promises not only an
    unrealistic half-trillion dollar tax cut, but also an expanded
    defense budget that would cut deeply into the civilian budget.
    The effect that this plan would have on our public science and
    technology investments would be very serious.</p>
    <p>Expert congressional budget analysts estimate that the Dole
    plan would re sult in a reduction of at least 40% in federal
    non-defense R&amp;D. In fact, Mr. Dole's planned reductions are
    far greater than anything contemplated by even the most fervent
    budget cutters. Such reductions would devastate a national
    research infrastructure, which has taken 50 years to develop
    and is the envy of the world.</p>
    <p>The Clinton/Gore Administration has worked with the U.S.
    science and en gineering community to enhance funding for basic
    research and to ensure that fundamental research remains
    unhindered by ideological pressures. They have ensured that the
    link between basic and applied research is sustained and are
    continuing to counter a sentiment on Capitol Hill that certain
    kinds of applied research are “corporate welfare.” This
    Administration has also opposed legislation to stymie funding
    for math and science education — proposals that would leave the
    nation at risk of losing a generation of bright, young
    researchers.</p>
    <p>Those of us in the science and engineering community must
    not allow these attitudes and proposals to become the pattern
    for the next four years. Far too much is at stake to sit on the
    sidelines.</p>
    <p>Some of you may be independent voters who have not felt
    comfortable within the structure of a political party. Some of
    you may have voted Republican or for a third party candidate in
    previous national elections. It doesn't matter. Some of us have
    felt the same way in previous campaigns.</p>
    <p>We are not partisans in the traditional sense. We are,
    however, determined advocates for rational science and
    technology policies, and feel strongly that this leads us to
    support President Clinton and Vice President Gore in the 1996
    election.</p>
    <p>Moreover, we believe, as do President Clinton and Vice
    President Gore, that one of the more important roles for
    government is to represent the interest of the future to the
    present. We recognize that our national science and technology
    investments will be under pressure in the next years under any
    Administration, as it brings the budget into balance. We should
    also recall that the siren song of massive tax cuts and defense
    buildups is what ballooned the deficit in the first place.</p>
    <p>In contrast, the Clinton/Gore Administration has
    demonstrated a commitment to the true pur pose of balancing the
    budget — namely, ensuring the foundation of further investment
    in our country's long-term economic growth and prosperity.
    Investments in research, technology, education, and the
    environment continue to be central to their vision and to their
    programs.</p>
    <p>In a September 13, 1996, letter to America's Nobel Prize
    winners, President Clinton laid his views on the line clearly:
    “My Administration remains dedicated to nurturing science in
    America. This requires both maintaining federal investments in
    research and education and creating the economic climate that
    fuels private-sector investment, as well as private-public
    partnerships in science and technology. America's research
    colleges and universities are the bedrock of American
    leadership in science and technology . . . and research is and
    will remain a priority for the Administration.”</p>
    <p>We look forward to the day when a bipartisan consensus on
    science, technology, and education will be restored and
    efforts, such as this one, will not be needed. Unfortunately,
    we have concluded that the differences are so sharp this year
    and of such important to the country that we must take our
    position to the public. We hope you also will reach that same
    conclusion and join “Scientists and Engineers for
    Clinton/Gore.”</p>
    <p>You can make a difference on several levels. First, you can
    fax back the accompanying form and become a charter member.
    Second, we hope you also will support those candidates for
    federal and gubernatorial elections who share our rational
    views of the importance of science and technology to the
    nation. Third, we hope that many of you participating in the
    activities of “Scientists and Engineers for Clinton/Gore” will
    talk with each other. If you wish — and only if you wish — we
    will put you in touch with other members in your area, and
    provide suggestions for using these contacts to organize and
    participate in Clinton/Gore events or on a local or national
    basis.</p>
    <p>We are asking you and your colleagues to join with us in
    this important endeavor by becoming a charter member of
    “Scientists and Engineers for Clinton/Gore” and by doing as
    much as feels right for you to help advance science and
    technology in the national interest.</p>
    <p>With appreciation for your consideration,</p>
    <p><br>
