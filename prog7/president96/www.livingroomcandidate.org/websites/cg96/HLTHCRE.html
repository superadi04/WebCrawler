            Prohibit health plans from restricting medical
            communications. Currently, some health plans require
            doctors to sign contracts that may inappropriately
            limit their ability to give patients information about
            referrals and alternative treatment. The President�s
            �anti-gag� initiative will encourage physicians to
            discuss a full range of treatment options with
            patients.

            Expand health care options for older veterans. The
            President has proposed the �Veterans Medicare
            Reimbursement Project of 1996,� legislation to open the
            VA system to Medicare- eligible veterans in a number of
            cities. This measure will allow the VA to receive
            reimbursement from Medicare, improving access to care
            for older veterans while lowering costs to the VA
            system.
