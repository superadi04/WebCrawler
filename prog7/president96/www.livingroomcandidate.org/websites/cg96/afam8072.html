<P>PRESS RELEASE
<BR>August 7, 1996


	<P>CLINTON/GORE '96 OPENS AFRICAN-AMERICAN OUTREACH OFFICE

<P>The Clinton/Gore ‘96 campaign headquarters announced the opening of its office of African American Outreach.   Located in Washington, D.C., the office is charged with raising the level of political participation by African Americans and increasing voter turnout of African Americans. 

<P>"The office of African American outreach is a vital component of the Clinton/Gore ‘96 campaign and will be instrumental in ensuring the success of President Clinton and Vice President Gore in the fall," noted Alan Wheat, Deputy Campaign Manager and Director of Public Liaison for the campaign, adding "the President has pledged his continued support and commitment to policies and initiatives that will have the greatest positive impact on the African American community"”

<P>Harold J. Gist will serve as the Assistant Director of Public Liaison and Director of African American Outreach.  Gist, an Arkansas native, served as the Deputy Director of the Community Services Division with the Democratic National Committee in Washington, D.C.  Gist will be responsible for identifying and mobilizing state leadership, as well as forming coalitions with African American organizations and allied groups to maximize support for President Clinton.

<P>Since taking office, President Clinton has amassed an impressive record on issues of concern to African Americans.  Under President Clinton’s leadership, the administration has provided incentives to create over 100,000 new African American businesses, with new tax cuts made available to 90 percent of all small businesses. President Clinton appointed the most diverse Cabinet and Administration in history, including four African American Cabinet-level officials.  Fourteen percent of all Administration appointees are African American;  more African Americans (45) serve in the White House now than at any time in history; and he nominated thirty-six African Americans to the federal bench.  In addition, President Clinton has created nine Economic Empowerment Zones and ninety-five Enterprise Communities.

<P>Also joining the office are Sandi Jackson and Mona Mohib as NationalOutreach Coordinator and Special Assistant, respectively.  Jackson, a native of Chicago, is a lawyer and served as Press Secretary to the late Congressman Mickey Leland.  Mohib, a Connecticut native, served as a Management Consultant and Government Relations Assistant for Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.
