    <p><tt>For Immediate Release<br>
    October 12, 1996</tt></p>
    <center>
      <tt><b>AMERICA�S GROWING ECONOMY IS GOOD FOR ASIAN PACIFIC
      AMERICAN FAMILIES</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>Washington-- On October 7, more than 2,500 CEO�s from
    around the nation personally endorsed the re-election of
    President Clinton and Vice President Gore. Praising President
    Clinton�s leadership in putting the economy "on the right
    track," the business leaders endorsed President Clinton�s
    economic plan that has reduced the deficit, invested in
    America�s workers, and strengthened our families.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>America�s strong economic growth has helped Asian
    Pacific American families across the nation. When President
    Clinton took office, America�s economy was stagnant. The
    deficit was skyrocketing, unemployment was high, and job growth
    was anemic. Four years after President Clinton took office,
    America�s economy is on the right track to the 21st century.
    The economy has created 10.5 million new jobs, 93 percent in
    the private sector. Basic industries have rebounded, with
    931,000 new construction jobs and nearly 120,000 new
    manufacturing jobs. America has the lowest combined
    unemployment, inflation, and mortgage rate since 1968. Consumer
    confidence is at its highest level in six years.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The growing economy is giving Asian Pacific American
    families greater opportunities to provide for their children.
    America�s family income is up $1,600 since passage of President
    Clinton�s 1993 Economic Plan. Real hourly wages are rising for
    the first time in a decade, and homeownership is at a 15-year
    high.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"President Clinton is committed to balancing the budget
    while providing targeted tax cuts for education, child-rearing,
    and home buying that strengthen our economy and help all
    Americans," said Sharon Singh, National Director of Asian
    Pacific American Outreach at Clinton/Gore �96. "The President
    will continue working to open foreign markets to American goods
    and increase the economic and personal security of working
    Americans. I am proud that business leaders such as Richard
    Park, who is President of U.S. Woopon; Rashid Chaudary, who is
    Chairman and CEO of Raani Corporation; Niranjan Shah, who is
    CEO of Globetrotters Engineering Corp.; Suzanne Ahn, who is
    Chairman of Texcom Cellular, Inc.; and Sue Ling Gin, who is
    President and CEO of Flying Food Fair have personally endorsed
    President Clinton�s economic policy."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton strongly believes that if we stick to
    America�s basic bargain--opportunity for all and responsibility
    from all--there is no limit to the economic success America can
    achieve.</tt></p>
