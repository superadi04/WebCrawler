    <p><tt>For Immediate Release<br>
    October 16, 1996</tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>WHY YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD VOTE FOR PRESIDENT
    CLINTON</b></tt></p>
    <p><tt>On election day, November 5, young people will play a
    significant role in deciding the course of America�s future. Do
    we want to continue moving forward with a stronger economy, a
    cleaner environment, more jobs and educational opportunity for
    all or do we want to move back to the failed economic policies
    of the past? The choice is clear.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>In 1992, 18-29 year olds were 21% of the electorate.
    Young people can have that impact again. President Clinton has
    a proven record of accomplishments for youth. In 1992,
    President Clinton came into office with a plan -- a plan that
    is working. Americans now have more jobs, less crime and
    stronger communities. "The President is fighting for your
    future. Young people need to come out, get involved and vote
    for the President on election day," said Deputy Campaign
    Manager, Alan Wheat.</tt></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li><tt>President Clinton strengthened and expanded America�s
      economy. The deficit was cut by 60 percent; more than 10.5
      million new jobs were created; we had the lowest unemployment
      in over 7.5 years; and interest rates decreased on car loans
      and home mortgages.</tt></li>
      <li><tt>President Clinton also opened the doors to higher
      education for more Americans by expanding student loans and
      lowering their cost, expanding scholarships, and establishing
      AmeriCorps, the national service initiative. He has proposed
      a $1,500 HOPE Scholarship tax cut for college tuition and
      $10,000 tuition tax deduction for education and training at
      any age.</tt></li>
      <li><tt>Under President Clinton, violent crime rates have
      gone down each and every year. He passed the Violence Against
      Women Act, which provides funds to prevent rape and the
      sexual exploitation of runaway and homeless youth.</tt></li>
    </ul>
    <p><tt>"President Clinton has a clear vision for what he wants
    America to be. He understands that the future of America
    depends on creating opportunity for young people. We need to be
    active participants in national politics to ensure that this
    vision becomes our reality. We need to get out and vote for
    Clinton/Gore on November 5th," said Nicole Boxer Rodham,
    National Youth Coordinator for Clinton/Gore �96.</tt></p>
