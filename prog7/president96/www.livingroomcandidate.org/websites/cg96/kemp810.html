<P>PRESS RELEASE
<BR>August 10, 1996


	<P>STATEMENT BY JOE LOCKHART
<BR>NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY


	<P>Bob Dole’s Vice Presidential selection demonstrates what the Dole/Gingrich Republican party is all about.  Bob Dole has now completed his transformation from deficit hawk to economic gambler willing to bet our economic future on a reckless supply side theory.  Bob Dole confirmed that women should not have the right to choose and anyone with an opposing view is not welcome in San Diego.  Finally, today’s selection proves who’s running the Republican party.  Jack Kemp survived the Robertson/Buchanan vetting process while other Republicans like Pete Wilson and Bill Weld are being silenced or sent home early.
