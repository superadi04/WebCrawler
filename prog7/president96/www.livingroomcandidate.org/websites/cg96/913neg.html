    <p><tt>For Immediate Release<br>
    September 13, 1996</tt></p>
    <p><tt>STATEMENT OF JOE LOCKHART<br>
    NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole is complaining that Clinton/Gore �96 is running
    a negative campaign. Clinton/Gore ads are based on issue
    comparisons of Senator Dole�s voting record. Bob Dole is
    equating informing the public with running a negative campaign.
    Is Bob Dole admitting that his vote to cut Medicare by $270
    billion and his consistent votes against the Family and Medical
    Leave Act were mistakes? Clearly, this newly discovered concern
    about negative campaigning is a thinly-veiled attempt to
    justify the multi-million dollar, negative smear campaign Bob
    Dole is planning to conduct.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Following is a fact sheet on Clinton/Gore vs. Bob Dole
    advertising.</tt></p>

    <p><tt>Bob Dole: Laying The Groundwork For A Negative Smear
    Campaign</tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>Clinton/Gore Ads Are 63% Positive, 37% Issue
    Comparison -- And 0% Personal Attack.</b> The facts simply do
    not support Bob Dole�s contention that President Clinton has
    been waging a negative campaign. Sixty-three percent (63%) of
    the time in ads run by Clinton-Gore have provided positive
    information about the President�s record. Thirty-seven percent
    (37%) of the time in the ads has compared the President and Bob
    Dole on issues. Most importantly, zero percent (0%) of the time
    in Clinton/Gore ads has been negative, personal attacks on Bob
    Dole. [Squier/Knapp/Ochs Communications, 9/13/96]</tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>Presidential Scholar Backs Up Positive Nature Of
    Clinton/Gore Ads.</b> Kathleen Hall Jamieson, Dean of the
    Annenberg School of Communications at the University of
    Pennsylvania, analyzed the 1996 presidential ad campaign. She
    concluded that this year -- so far -- the campaign ads have
    been more positive than in the past. On the Clinton/Gore ads,
    Ms. Jamieson said: "...what you�re seeing in many of these
    instances is Dole puts up an ad and Clinton comes...up on that
    subject immediately with an ad that addresses it. The Clinton
    ads are doing so in a comparative fashion, not simply
    attacking. And that�s positive.... When you get ads that
    compare, the electorate has more chance to learn, because
    you�re hearing something from both sides." [CNN,
    9/9/96]</tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>The Clinton/Gore Ads Aren�t Negative. Bob Dole�s
    Record Is Negative.</b> If Bob Dole thinks it is negative to
    say he tried to cut Medicare by $270 billion -- then he
    shouldn�t have voted with Newt Gingrich to cut Medicare by $270
    billion.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>If Bob Dole thinks it is negative to say that he opposed
    putting 100,000 new police on the street -- then he shouldn�t
    have voted with Newt Gingrich against the President�s 1994
    Anti-Crime Bill.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>If Bob Dole thinks it is negative to say that he opposes
    allowing families unpaid time off at work to care for a sick
    parent or child -- then he shouldn�t have VOTED against the
    Family and Medical Leave Act. And he should stop campaigning
    against it.</tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>Infamous For Dark Campaigns, Dole�s First Primary Ad
    Attacked The President.</b> Remember Bob Dole�s history of
    dark, negative campaigning? Bob Dole: snapped at George Bush on
    national television in 1988, saying "Stop lying about my
    record!"; called World War I, World War II, the Korean War and
    Vietnam "Democrat wars..." during the 1976 vice presidential
    debate; and asked high school children, during his close 1974
    re-election campaign, to go home and "ask your mother if she
    knows how many abortions" his opponent and OBGYN, Dr. Bill Roy,
    had performed. [NBC Nightly News, 2/17/88; 1976 CQ Almanac, (p.
    17); UPI, transcript of 10/15/76 debate; New York Times,
    11/8/87]</tt></p>
    <p><tt>And 1996 has been no different. The very first
    television ad Bob Dole ran during the 1995 primary campaign was
    a negative attack on the President -- not a vision for where he
    wanted to lead the country.</tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>With No One Buying Dole�s Economic Scheme, Bob Dole
    Is Going Negative.</b> The bottom line? The facts do not
    support the Dole campaign�s contention that Clinton/Gore `96 is
    running a negative campaign. So why is Bob Dole saying this
    now? Simple, Dole is lagging in the polls. No one is buying his
    last-minute, risky economic scheme. And Dole has no new ideas
    about improving the future for working American families. The
    loud complaining is a thinly veiled attempt to justify the 11th
    hour, multi-million dollar, negative smear campaign Bob Dole is
    planning to conduct.</tt></p>
