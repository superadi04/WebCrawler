    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    September 2, 1996</tt></p>
    <p><tt>On Labor Day, the nation celebrates America's workers.
    President Clinton has a solid record of support for American
    workers and a plan to help working families into the 21st
    century. Under President Clinton's leadership, 10 million new
    jobs have been created. America has the lowest combined rates
    of unemployment, inflation and home mortgages in 28 years. And
    by expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit, President Clinton
    has provided a tax cut for 15 million families. President
    Clinton also increased the minimum wage which provides a raise
    for 10 million workers; signed the Family and Medical Leave Act
    into law and has proposed tax cuts for education and
    child-rearing that are paid for in his balanced budget
    plan.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Attached is a comparison of President Clinton's and
    Senator Dole's record for helping working families.</tt></p>

      <tt><b>Creating 10 Million New Jobs</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>In 1992, President Clinton promised to create 8 million
    new jobs. In fact, under President Clinton's leadership, the
    economy has created 10 million new jobs. Under President
    Clinton, the unemployment rate for Americans has dropped by
    1.3%. [U.S. Dept. of Labor]</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich led all Republicans in voting
    against the President's 1993 economic plan. Dole predicted "it
    will not create jobs." Dole also voted against tax relief for
    15 million working families included in the President's
    economic plan. [Congressional Record, 4/5/93; 1993 CQ Almanac,
    Vote #247]</tt></p>

      <tt><b>Increasing The Minimum Wage For American
      Workers</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>In his 1995 State of the Union address, President
    Clinton said, "I believe that you should raise the minimum
    wage... It rewards work." On August 20, 1996, the President
    signed a 90� increase in the minimum wage, from $4.25 to $5.15
    an hour. The measure was originally opposed by the Republicans.
    [AP, 8/20/96; NY Times, 8/3/96; 1995 State Of The Union,
    1/24/95]</tt></p>
    <p><tt>During his final two-and-one-half months as Senate
    Majority Leader, Dole blocked attempts by Democrats to raise
    the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 per-hour. When the issue
    came up, Dole said, "I assume that sooner or later the issue
    will be debated and voted on, directly or indirectly... but not
    today, not tomorrow, and not next week." [New York Times,
    3/27/96; Time, 4/29/96]</tt></p>
    <center>
      <tt><b>Passing The Family & Medical Leave Bill</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>In 1993, President Clinton signed the Family and Medical
    Leave Act which provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid,
    job-protected leave per year with health insurance coverage for
    the birth or adoption of a child, or the serious illness of the
    employee or an immediate family member. [1993 CQ Almanac, p.
    390]</tt></p>
    <p><tt>In 1988, Dole blocked the Family & Medical Leave Bill
    and voted against the bill in 1991 & 1992, saying, "I don't
    think this has anything to do with family values..." In 1993
    Dole again led a GOP filibuster of the bill and voted against
    the bill which passed 71-27. [1993 CQ Almanac, Vote # 11, p.
    3-S; 1988 CQ Almanac, p.26-263; Vote # 355, p. 58-S; 1991 CQ
    Almanac, p. 312-313, Vote # 215, p. 28-S; 1992 CQ Almanac, p.
    354; Vote # 232, p. 30-S; Hutchinson News, 9/26/92]</tt></p>

      <tt><b>Targeting Tax Cuts At Education &
      Child-Rearing</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>President Clinton has proposed a balanced budget with
    $110 billion in tax cuts targeted at education and
    child-rearing including:<br>
    — A $1,500 HOPE Scholarship tax cut for the first 2 years of
    college tuition.<br>
    — A $10,000 tuition tax deduction for education and training at
    any age.<br>
    — A $500 per child tax credit for young children.<br>
    — Expanded savings (IRAs) for education, retirement, first-time
    homebuyers.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Senator Dole's risky economic scheme would cause 40%
    cuts in domestic spending areas including: education,
    environmental protection, the FBI, the border patrol, national
    parks, air traffic control & highways. These are even deeper
    cuts than the American public rejected in the extreme 1995
    Dole/Gingrich budget. [BusinessWeek, 8/19/96; Concord
    Coalition, 8/14/96]</tt></p>
