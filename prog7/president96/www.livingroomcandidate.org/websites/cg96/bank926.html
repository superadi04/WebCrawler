    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    September 26, 1996</tt>
    <p><tt>CLINTON/GORE CAMPAIGN COMMITTEES DEPOSIT FUNDS IN
    MINORITY-OWNED, COMMUNITY-BASED BANKS</tt></p>
    <p><tt>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The Clinton/Gore Campaign Committees
    will deposit five million dollars of its campaign funds into
    four of the nation�s leading minority-owned, community-focused
    banks on September 30, announced Clinton/Gore Campaign Manager
    Peter S. Knight today.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Each bank will receive deposits totalling $1.25 million,
    making it the largest sum ever deposited into minority-owned
    banks by a Democratic presidential general election committee.
    The four banks are United Bank of Philadelphia; International
    Bank of Commerce in Laredo, Texas; Banco Popular in New York
    City; and Citizens Trust Bank in Atlanta, Georgia.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>In announcing the transfers, Knight said, "Today�s
    action reflects the President�s deep commitment to urban
    redevelopment and minority-owned businesses. It also represents
    the President�s long-held view that expanding opportunity and
    investing in communities are key elements in keeping America on
    track as we head into the 21st century."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton has a strong record of supporting
    community economic empowerment. Among other initiatives he has
    championed, such as raising the minimum wage and expanding the
    Earned Income Tax Credit for working families, the President
    established the Community Development Banks and Financial
    Institutions Fund to leverage private investments; expanded the
    Community Reinvestment Act that will help unleash billions in
    new credits for economic development in distressed communities;
    created a network of community development banks in low-and
    moderate-income communities; and established one-stop capital
    shops that are distributing millions in loans and investment
    for small and minority-owned businesses.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Deputy Campaign Manager and Chief Operating Officer,
    Theodore Carter explained that the banks were chosen on the
    strength of their community involvement as well as their solid
    financial position. "The President consistently stresses that
    it is good business to support companies that invest in their
    communities," said Carter.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>International Bank of Commerce, incorporated in 1966, is
    the largest Hispanic-owned commercial bank in the U.S. Citizens
    Trust Bank was incorporated in 1921 and has eight branches in
    Atlanta. United Bank of Philadelphia, founded in 1992, is the
    first African American controlled, full-service bank
    established in the city since 1923. Banco Popular in New York
    City is a branch of Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, the largest
    banking operation on the island.</tt></p>
