    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    September 2, 1996</tt>
    <p><tt>STATEMENT BY JOE LOCKHART<br>
    NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY</tt></p>
    <p><tt>BOB DOLE'S ECONOMIC FANTASY</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole's campaign took another step into economic
    fantasy land tonight. In an interview with "60 minutes,"
    Senator Dole took yet another federal program -- Medicaid --
    off the table for reaching the budget cuts he will need to make
    up for the $550 billion budget hole created by his
    election-year economic scheme.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>To recount the bidding, Senator Dole now has taken
    Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, veteran's benefits,
    defense spending and energy labs off the table.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>All independent analysts agree it is simply impossible
    to cut taxes by $550 billion and not make severe cuts in
    Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment -- and still
    balance the budget. Bob Dole needs to tell the American public
    the truth about how to pay for his economic scheme --
    line-by-line and dime-by-dime.</tt></p>
