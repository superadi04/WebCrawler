    <p><tt>PRESS RELEASE<br>
    October 12, 1996</tt></p>
    <center>
      <tt><b>HUNGARIAN AMERICAN LEADERS FORM<br>
      NATIONAL CLINTON/GORE �96 STEERING COMMITTEE</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>WASHINGTON -- The Clinton/Gore campaign today announced
    the formation of the honorary �Hungarian Americans for
    Clinton/Gore National Steering Committee.�</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Members of the committee are distinguished Hungarian
    Americans from California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland,
    Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. These leaders
    will develop state steering committees in an effort to increase
    voter support for the President among Hungarian Americans. With
    less than a month left until election day, �Hungarian Americans
    for Clinton/Gore �96" will focus on the following
    activities:</tt></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>*Informing the Hungarian American community of the
      President�s accomplishments;<br>
      *Identifying voters in the community; and<br>
      *Rallying Hungarian Americans behind the reelection of the
      President and Vice President.</tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><tt>�The support of Hungarian Americans confirms President
    Clinton�s record of achievement on issues that matter most to
    all Americans--maintaining our leadership abroad in the fight
    for democracy and human rights, while working to strengthen our
    families and communities,� said Alan Wheat, Deputy Campaign
    Manager and Director of Public Liaison. �President Clinton has
    led an international effort to promote a democratic and
    market-oriented Hungary, and to expand NATO membership. The
    President has also worked hard to strengthen American families
    and communities by helping to create 10.5 million new jobs, by
    enacting the Family and Medical Leave Act, and by spearheading
    tough crime control laws.�</tt></p>
    <p><tt>�President Clinton has earned the support of Hungarian
    American voters,� said Peter Ujvagi, who is a City Councilman
    from Toledo, OH. �He understands the needs of our communities
    at home, and he enthusiastically supports the reemergence of
    democracy in the land of our forefathers as Hungary rejoins the
    Western community of nations. I urge all Hungarian Americans to
    cast their vote on November 5 for President Clinton and Vice
    President Gore.�</tt></p>
