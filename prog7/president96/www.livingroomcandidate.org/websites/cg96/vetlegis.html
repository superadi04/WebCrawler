    For Immediate Release<br>
    October 10, 1996</tt>

      <tt><b>PRESIDENT CLINTON SIGNS VETERANS LEGISLATION</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>Washington, D.C. -- President Clinton yesterday signed
    three pieces of veterans legislation that will ensure that
    veterans� benefits keep pace with inflation, improve the VA
    health care system, and expand numerous other veterans�
    programs and benefits.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"These three laws demonstrate again that the President
    has veterans� best interests at heart," said Tom Keefe,
    Director of Veterans Outreach. "From increasing and expanding
    veterans� benefits to improving VA care, President Clinton has
    been veterans� best friend in the White House since Franklin
    Roosevelt."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The first law, the Veterans� Health Care Eligibility
    Reform Act of 1996 (H.R. 3118), revises the archaic and arcane
    rules governing eligibility for VA care and gives the VA new
    tools to improve its efficiency. The legislation includes many
    proposals recommended by the National Performance Review headed
    by Vice President Al Gore in order to establish a modern,
    integrated health care system. Eligibility reform has also been
    a high priority of veterans� groups.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The second law, the Veterans� Compensation
    Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 1996 (H.R. 3458), authorizes a
    cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2.3 million disabled
    veterans who receive disability compensation; over 300,000
    individuals who receive benefits as surviving spouses or
    children of service members whose death was service-connected;
    and veterans who receive clothing allowances because they wear
    or use prosthetic or orthopedic devices.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The final law, the Veterans� Benefits Improvements Act
    of 1996 (S. 1711) expands and extends numerous veterans
    education, housing, life insurance, and employment and training
    benefits.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"Add these three new laws up and you get a man who looks
    after the needs of America�s veterans," said Deputy Campaign
    Manager Alan Wheat. "President Clinton has proven his
    commitment to veteran issues."</tt></p>
