              Pennsylvania is the country�s 27th largest
              agricultural exporting state, shipping $431 million
              in agricultural exports abroad or 1.0% of the U.S.
              total in 1994 (latest year available for Department
              of Agriculture state export data). The two largest
              export categories, Live Animals and Meat (excluding
              poultry), and Other Products (mainly confectionery,
              nursery and greenhouse, essential oils, beverages, or
              other miscellaneous animal and vegetable products),
              accounted for over 42 percent of Pennsylvania�s
              agricultural exports in 1994. Given the 22 percent
              increase in total U.S. agriculture exports in 1995,
              agriculture exports from the state of Pennsylvania in
              1995 will likely range between $500 million and $550
              million.
