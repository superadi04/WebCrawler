    PRESS RELEASE<br>

      <tt><b>TRANSCRIPT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON�S FREE AIR TIME
      REMARKS</b></tt>

    <p><tt><i>President Clinton�s remarks will air on the following
    stations: PBS, CNN, C-SPAN, NPR and NOSTALGIA
    TELEVISION.</i></tt></p>
    <p><tt>The issue before the American people is who can best
    lead our country into the 21st century.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Four years ago, I ran for President at a time of high
    unemployment and rising frustration. Vice President Gore and I
    wanted to turn this country around, by restoring our basic
    bargain: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an
    American community where everybody has a role to play. I wanted
    a government that was smaller and less bureaucratic -- to give
    people the tools they need to make the most of their own
    lives.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Four years ago, the American people took me on faith.
    Today, there�s a record: 10 and a half million new jobs. Rising
    incomes. Falling crime and welfare rolls. An America that is
    strong and at peace. We are better off than we were four years
    ago. Now let�s keep going.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>We cut the deficit by 60 percent. Now let�s balance the
    budget while protecting Medicare, Medicaid, education and the
    environment.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans. Now let�s
    cut taxes to help families raise and educate their children,
    pay for medical emergencies, buy a home and sell it without
    paying taxes.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>We passed Family Leave. Now let�s extend it, so more
    people can succeed at home and at work.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>We passed the Brady Bill and the assault weapons ban,
    and we started putting 100,000 police on the streets. Now let�s
    finish that job and target violent teen gangs.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>We passed historic welfare reform, and increased child
    support collection by 50 percent. Now let�s move a million more
    people from welfare to work.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Above all, we must make education our highest priority.
    We must make sure every child can read independently by the
    third grade, and connect every classroom to the Information
    Superhighway. We should make the first two years of college as
    universal as high school is today by making a typical community
    college free with a $1,500 tax cut for those two years, and a
    tax deduction up to $10,000 a year good at any
    college.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>If we do these things, every 8-year-old will be able to
    read, every 12-year-old will be able to log onto the Internet,
    every 18-year-old will be able to go to college.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>A balanced budget. Safer, stronger families. Welfare to
    work. Opportunity through education. That�s the way to build a
    bridge to the 21st century, and give every child a chance at
    the American dream.</tt></p>
