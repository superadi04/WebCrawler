              Nebraska is the country�s fourth largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $2.5 billion in
              agricultural exports abroad or 5.7% of the U.S. total
              in 1994 (latest year available for Department of
              Agriculture state export data). The largest export
              categories, feed grains and live animals and meat
              (excluding poultry), accounted for over 55 percent of
              Nebraska�s agricultural exports in 1994. Given the 22
              percent increase in total U.S. agriculture exports in
              1995, agriculture exports from Nebraska in 1995 will
              likely range between $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion.
