    <p><tt>7/2/96<br>
    PRESS RELEASE</tt></p>
    <p><tt>REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT<br>
    BEFORE THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF SENIOR CITIZENS</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Chicago, Illinois<br>
    July 2, 1996</tt></p>
    <p><tt>One of the things that I tried to do -- it's turned out
    to be very controversial and I now see why no previous
    President ever wanted to get into this -- is I believe that we
    should take strong action to stop the advertising, sales, and
    transference of cigarettes to children. I think it's
    wrong.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>You talk about saving money. Three thousand children a
    day smoke -- start smoking -- begin. Three thousand children a
    day begin. One thousand of them will have their lives shortened
    because of it. And along the way society will pick up a
    significant part of the health care bill. Now, that's one way
    to save money.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Now, I have been amazed at the debate that's injected
    itself into the national campaign on this issue. I notice that
    Senator Dole questioned the other day whether or not tobacco
    was really addictive for everybody. And then, apparently, this
    morning, when it was -- he was asked about Dr. Koop, who was
    President Reagan's Surgeon General, a remarkable man, who may
    be a Republican for all I know -- President Reagan's Surgeon
    General, but he has been one of our most outspoken advocates of
    trying to stop smoking among young people -- and this morning
    Senator Dole suggested that maybe Dr. Koop had been brainwashed
    by the liberal media. Well, I imagine Dr. Koop was surprised to
    hear that.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>I believe Dr. Koop knows more about the dangers of
    tobacco than the so-called liberal media or Senator Dole. He's
    out there fighting for our children, and that's what we need
    more people to do -- fight for children and not play politics
    with this issue.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Medicaid today spends at least $10 billion in federal
    and state funds to pay for treatment for smoking-related
    illnesses. Now, if we're going to get serious about cutting the
    costs, that's one way to do it without hurting families. It
    will help families, it will strengthen families.</tt></p>
