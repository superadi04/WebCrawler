<p><center><b>MORE THAN 2,500 CEO’S AND BUSINESS LEADERS ENDORSE PRESIDENT CLINTON,
<br>PRESS ACTIVITIES MARKING ENDORSEMENT HELD IN 27 STATES</b>
</center>
	

<P>Praising President Clinton’s leadership in putting the economy "on the right track," more than 2,500 CEO’s and business leaders from around the nation today endorsed the reelection of President Clinton and Vice President Gore.  President Clinton accepted the endorsement at an event with over 300 of these business leaders in Stamford, Connecticut.

	<p>The Stamford event kicks off press activities in 27 states across the country today.   The activities feature business leaders, economists, community activists and Clinton/Gore campaign officials. (See attached list.)

	<p>The business leaders supporting President Clinton and Vice President Gore represent a broad cross-section of American industry -- from agriculture to aerospace -- and from all fifty states.  They include many of the leading names in American business, small business owners, women, Republicans, and minority business leaders. 

	<p>President Clinton used the occasion to call on business leaders to work with him to continue strengthening the economy and to help move people from welfare to work.  "Together with American business, we have put our economy on the right track -- with more jobs and more opportunity, and 1.9 million fewer people on welfare than the day I took office.  But we must ensure that everyone can reap the rewards of a strong economy.  Every business has a role to play in moving people from welfare to work," he said.

	<p>Business leaders at the Stamford event agreed to meet President Clinton’s challenge.  The President acknowledged their support saying, "I am pleased that so many of the nation’s business leaders are rising to the challenge of our new welfare reform law, and finding new ways to replace welfare checks with paychecks." 


	<p>William Esrey, who is CEO of Sprint Corporation and a long-time Republican, explained why the business leaders were supporting the President and the Vice President.  "There has been a realization that the Clinton Administration has been good for American business.  President Clinton has shown that he believes that business is part of the solution, not the problem, for America," he said.

	<p>Agnes Mu, who is owner of a California-based travel business added, "President Clinton has helped my dream come true.  Four years ago, my business almost closed because the economy was so bad.  Now, under President Clinton, the economy is back, business is good, and small businesses like mine are succeeding, growing and creating new jobs."

	<p>This coalition will continue to build support for President Clinton and Vice President Gore, explained Steven Rattner, who is Managing Director of the investment firm Lazard Freres & Co.  Rattner pointed to the success of "Wall Street and Main Street" businesses under President Clinton as the reason for the enthusiastic response to the coalition’s work.  "Wall Street has seen the economy make remarkable progress in the past four years under President Clinton.  The stock market continues to set new records, more than 10.5 million new jobs have been created, and we are creating whole new industries in areas such as information and technology."

	<p>Mary Walker, who is CEO of Expanding Technologies, Inc. and President of the National Federation of Black Women Business Owners, concluded, "President Clinton has been a big supporter of small business.  He has helped create opportunity for millions of Americans -- including record numbers of women -- to open businesses, work, succeed, and improve the quality of life for themselves and their families."
