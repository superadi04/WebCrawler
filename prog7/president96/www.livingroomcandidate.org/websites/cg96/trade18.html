              Indiana is the country�s seventh largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $1.7 billion in
              agricultural exports abroad or 3.8 percent of the
              U.S. total in 1994 (latest year available for
              Department of Agriculture state export data).
              Indiana�s largest agriculture export categories, feed
              grains and soybeans, accounted for nearly 80 percent
              of Indiana�s agricultural exports in 1994. Given the
              22 percent increase in total U.S. agriculture exports
              in 1995, agriculture exports from Indiana in 1995
              will likely range between $1.9 billion and $2.1
              billion.
