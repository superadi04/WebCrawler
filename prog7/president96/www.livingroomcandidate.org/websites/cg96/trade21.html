              Missouri is the country�s 16th largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $898 million in
              agricultural exports abroad or 2.1% of the U.S. total
              in 1994 (latest year available for Department of
              Agriculture state export data). The largest export
              categories, soybeans and feed grains, accounted for
              over 60 percent of Missouri�s agricultural exports in
              1994. Given the 22 percent increase in total U.S.
              agriculture exports in 1995, agriculture exports from
              Missouri in 1995 will likely range between $1.0
              billion and $1.1 billion.
