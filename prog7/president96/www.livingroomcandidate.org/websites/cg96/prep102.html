    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    October 2, 1996</tt>
    <p><tt>STATEMENT BY JOE LOCKHART<br>
    NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY</tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>With Eleven Days to Prep, What Will Bob Dole Have To
    Say For Himself?</b></tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole has spent an <u>unprecedented</u> amount of
    time this week preparing for his first debate with President
    Clinton and publicly musing about what the President will say.
    Consider the following:</tt></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>Since Thursday, September 26, <b><i>eleven days before
      the first debate</i></b>, Bob Dole has all but ceased
      non-debate related campaigning;</tt></p>
      <p><tt>Even his weekly response to President Clinton�s radio
      address eight days before the first debate was devoted to a
      discussion of the debate the following week;</tt></p>
      <p><tt>Taking a respite from the sun in Bal Harbour, Florida
      - which gave rise to one of the most memorable lines from the
      campaign, �The naked eye may think he�s sitting in the sun
      boiling like a lobster when he�s really thinking like a fox,�
      - Bob Dole travelled Tuesday to Ohio and will be in
      Pennsylvania tomorrow to remind the people of Elizabethtown
      how important Sunday�s debate will be for him;</tt></p>
      <p><tt>In his only other non-debate prep time this week, Bob
      Dole will spend a couple of hours in Tennessee and Georgia --
      on the way back to Bal Harbour.</tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><tt><b>Could it be that Bob Dole needs eleven days to come
    up with answers for the record he�s compiled after 35 years in
    Congress? Attached are just 10 of Bob Dole�s greatest hits on
    America�s working families.</b></tt></p>

    <p><tt>1. 1965: DOLE VOTED AGAINST CREATING THE MEDICARE
    PROGRAM: On July 27, 1965, then-Representative Bob Dole voted
    against passage of the conference report creating Medicare (H
    Rept 682). Just 3 months earlier, on April 8, 1965, Dole voted
    against House passage of legislation creating the Medicare
    program (HR 6675). Instead, Dole voted to recommit HR 6675 to
    the Ways and Means Committee with instructions to substitute a
    "voluntary" Medicare bill. During a 1995 speech to the American
    Conservative Union, Dole bragged about this vote, saying, "I
    was there, fighting the fight, voting against Medicare -- one
    of twelve, because we knew it wouldn't work in 1965." [CQ
    Almanac, 1965, p. 252, 950, 982; Votes # 34, 35, 97; Dole ACU
    Speech, 10/24/95]</tt></p>
    <p><tt>2. 1965: DOLE VOTED AGAINST CREATING THE STUDENT LOAN
    PROGRAM: On October 20, 1965, Dole was one of only 63
    Representatives who voted against the conference report on the
    Higher Education Act of 1965, which established guaranteed
    federal student loans for higher education. The bill marked
    "the first time in U.S. history [that] Congress approved
    federal scholarships for undergraduate students." The bill
    authorized $70 million annually to provide 140,000 students
    with scholarships. The bill also established a federally
    insured private loan program, with interest subsidies paid by
    the government. [CQ Almanac, 1965, p. 294, p. 1020, Vote # 197;
    CQ Almanac, 1966, p. 299]</tt></p>
    <p><tt>3. 1982: DOLE AUTHORED FOR THE LARGEST PEACETIME TAX
    INCREASE IN HISTORY: In 1982, Bob Dole wrote, voted for, and,
    passed the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982
    (TEFRA 82). Dole's plan increased taxes by $298 billion in 1993
    constant dollars. Dole's tax increase amounted to 1.06% of GDP
    -- nearly 60% larger than the tax increases on the wealthiest
    1.2% contained in President Clinton's 1993 economic package
    (0.67% of GDP). [CQ Almanac, 1982, p. 55-S, Vote # 337; Wall
    Street Journal, 10/26/94] The New York Times wrote, "When
    adjusted for inflation -- the only way to make comparisons of
    dollar amounts from different years -- a tax increase
    engineered by Mr. Dole in 1982, when he was the chairman of the
    Senate Finance Committee, was larger [than the President's 1993
    economic plan.]" The Times criticized a November 1995 Dole
    commercial which claimed that President Clinton passed the
    largest tax increase as "not true" and "dubious." [New York
    Times, 11/03/95]</tt></p>
    <p><tt>4. 1965: DOLE VOTED AGAINST THE ORIGINAL HEAD START
    AUTHORIZATION: On July 22, 1965, Dole voted against amendments
    to the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 -- which authorized
    funds for Project Head Start. Project Head Start offered social
    services, health services and pre-learning experiences to
    children from deprived families. [CQ Almanac, 1965, p. 410, p.
    980, Vote # 95]</tt></p>
    <p><tt>5. 1994: DOLE VOTED AGAINST 100,000 NEW POLICE OFFICERS
    & ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN: Dole voted against President Clinton's
    1994 crime bill and led the GOP filibuster of the bill. This
    bill gave grants to law enforcement agencies to put 100,000 new
    community police officers on the nation�s streets and banned 19
    specific kinds of assault weapons, among other things. When
    asked if he had the votes to block the bill, Dole said, �I hope
    I have, I think I have, but I�m prepared to move ahead in any
    event.� Dole's filibuster failed and the crime bill passed by a
    61-38 vote. [Reuters, 8/24/94; CQ Almanac, 1994, p. 50-S, Vote
    # 293-295]</tt></p>
    <p><tt>6. 1995: DOLE VOTED FOR THE EXTREME 1995 REPUBLICAN
    BUDGET: Bob Dole voted for the extreme 1995 GOP budget, which
    did a number of destructive things, including:<br>
    Cut Medicare by $270 Billion: The Dole/Gingrich reconciliation
    bill would have cut Medicare by $270 billion over seven years.
    [CBO, Analysis of HR 2491, 11/16/95]<br>
    Cut Education & Training and Eliminated Direct Student Loans:
    Dole backed $31 billion in education and training cuts and the
    near-elimination of direct student loans. [FY97 Budget Report,
    Chart 8-1; ]<br>
    Cut Medicaid by $163 Billion: The Dole/Gingrich budget would
    have cut Medicaid by $163 billion over seven years and
    eliminated the guarantee of meaningful health care to children,
    seniors, the disabled and pregnant women. [Congressional
    Quarterly, 11/25/95, p. 3613, vote #584, 11/17/95; CBO Analysis
    of H.R. 2491, 11/16/95]<br>
    Gutted Environmental Protections: The Dole/Gingrich budget
    would have cut safe drinking water funding by 45% , toxic dump
    cleanup by 25% and environmental enforcement by 25%. [Los
    Angeles Times, 12/17/95; CQ, 12/16/95, vote #606, p. 3843,
    12/14/95; Statement of Administration Policy on H.R. 2099,
    12/14/95; Veto Message on H.R. 2099, 12/18/95]</tt></p>
    <p><tt>7. 1963: DOLE VOTED AGAINST CREATION OF THE CLEAN AIR
    ACT IN 1963: On December 10, 1963, Dole voted against the
    Conference Report on H.R. 6518, the Clean Air Act. The bill
    initiated and strengthened programs for the prevention and
    abatement of air pollution. The measure passed 273-109 (R
    69-94; D 204-15). Dole also voted against original passage of
    the Clean Air Act on July 18, 1963. [CQ Almanac, 1963, p. 236;
    p. 648, Vote # 104; p. 620, Vote # 47]</tt></p>
    <p><tt>8. 1993: DOLE VOTED AGAINST BRADY BILL, WHICH HAS KEPT
    GUNS FROM 43,000 FELONS: In 1993 Dole led Republican opposition
    to the Brady Bill -- a five-day waiting period for the purchase
    of a handgun to allow for background checks -- and voted
    against final passage of the bill, saying, "We lost one." The
    measure passed 63-36 (R 16-28; D 47-8). The Brady Law is
    working to keep handguns out of the hands of felons. In 1995,
    60,613 people were denied access to a handgun as a result of
    background checks. Of those, 43,217 individuals were denied
    because they were convicted felons. [CQ Almanac, 1993, p. 300 -
    302; p. 50-S, 51-S, Votes # 387, 390, 394; Houston Chronicle,
    11/25/93; BATF, 1/18/96]</tt></p>
    <p><tt>9. DOLE OPPOSED MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE AT LEAST 10 TIMES
    IN HIS CAREER: Bob Dole voted against or opposed increases in
    the minimum wage at least 10 times during his career --
    including voting against raising the minimum wage from $1.00
    per hour to $1.25 per hour in 1961, his freshmen year in
    Congress. Dole also opposed minimum wage increases in 1966,
    1972, 1973, 1987, 1988, 1993, 1995, 1996. [CQ Almanac, 1961, p.
    518, Vote # 14; Associated Press, 3/26/96; CQ Almanac, 1972, p.
    43-S, Vote # 270; CQ Almanac, 1966, p. 882, Vote # 60; CQ
    Almanac, 1973, p. 48-S, Vote # 296; CQ Almanac, p. 40-S, Vote #
    222; CQ Almanac, p. 55-S, Vote # 336]</tt></p>
    <p><tt>10. DOLE REPEATEDLY DELAYED, THEN VOTED AGAINST FAMILY &
    MEDICAL LEAVE: In 1993, Bob Dole filibustered and voted against
    the Family and Medical Leave Act, which provides workers with
    up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for the birth or adoption of a
    child or the illness of a close family member. From 1988
    through 1993 Dole opposed and led filibusters against passage
    of the Act. In 1992, Dole voted against overriding President
    Bush's veto of the bill, saying, "I don't think this has
    anything to do with family values..." [Democratic Study Group,
    6/13/94, CQ Almanac, 1993, p. 391; p. 3-S, Vote # 11; Hutchison
    News, 9/26/92; CQ Almanac, 1988, p. 261-263; p. 58-S, Vote #
    355; CQ Almanac, 1992, p. 354; Vote # 232, p. 30-S]</tt></p>
