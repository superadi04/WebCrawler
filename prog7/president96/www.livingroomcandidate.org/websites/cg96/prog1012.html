    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    October 12, 1996</tt>
    <center>
      <p><tt><b>STATEMENT BY ANN LEWIS<br>
      DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER</b></tt></p>
    </center>
    <p><tt>Instead of discussing the issues of this campaign, or
    offering their own substantive vision for America�s future, the
    Dole-Kemp campaign is trying to divert attention with a cynical
    exercise decrying negative campaign tactics even as they employ
    them. Apparently they don�t want to talk about why Bob Dole has
    pledged to abolish the Department of Education; or why he
    opposes the Brady Bill and the Family and Medical Leave Act; or
    how he can possibly pay for a half trillion dollar risky tax
    scheme that Republicans and Democrats alike agree will balloon
    the deficit and endanger Medicare.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton continues to discuss issues that
    concern the direction of our nation. In less than four years in
    office, President Clinton has changed the course of the
    American economy. This Administration has reduced the deficit
    by 60 %. The American economy has responded by creating 10.5
    million new jobs. This Administration is making our streets
    safer for our children -- there are more police on the street,
    fewer guns on the street and the crime rate is going down. This
    President has made education a priority, opening the door of
    higher education to more young people. President Clinton has a
    vision for the next four years that will build on these
    accomplishments, with targetted tax cuts for college tuition
    and expanded IRAs for families.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>That�s leadership in addressing "real problems"</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton has urged that this be a campaign of
    issues, not insults. The American people will be better served
    if the Dole-Kemp campaign also lives up to this
    standard.</tt></p>
