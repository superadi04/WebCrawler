    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    October, 11 1996</tt>
    <center>
      <tt><b>41 STATES HOLD "DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS DAY"
      ACTIVITIES TO HIGHLIGHT IMPACT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON�S
      ANTI-DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAWS</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>The Clinton/Gore campaign today announced that it will
    celebrate "Domestic Violence Awareness Day" on October 12,
    1996. On this day, advocates, 24-hour hotline beneficiaries,
    grant recipients under the Violence Against Women Act and COPS
    program, business leaders, union leaders, and political leaders
    will participate in press activities in 41 states highlighting
    the remarkable accomplishments this Administration has made in
    domestic violence prevention.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The President has officially proclaimed October
    "National Domestic Violence Awareness Month." Across the
    nation, local organizations are holding conferences, vigils,
    and other events to increase awareness and build unity around
    this disturbing issue. Millions of women and children
    throughout our nation are plagued by the terror of family
    violence each year, and approximately 20 percent of all
    hospital emergency room visits by women result from such
    violence. As many as three million children witness violence in
    their homes each year. It is only by stopping violence at home
    that we will ultimately end violence in the streets.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"By holding press activities nationwide on October 12,
    the campaign hopes to underscore the Administration�s
    commitment to -- and turn a national spotlight on -- efforts to
    end domestic violence," said Clinton/Gore Campaign Manager
    Peter S. Knight.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The President has an unprecedented record on combating
    domestic violence:</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton signed the Violence Against Women Act
    (VAWA) into law, which is providing $156 million to strengthen
    the criminal justice system�s response to crimes of violence
    against women. President Clinton created a 24-hour Domestic
    Violence Hotline, 1-800-799-SAFE, which has already provided
    immediate crisis intervention, counseling and referrals for
    over 42,000 women.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The Administration allocated $46 million under the
    Community Oriented Policing program (COPS) to help law
    enforcement counter domestic violence. The President created
    the Violence Against Women Office in the Department of Justice
    to lead a national effort to combine tough new federal laws
    with help for states and localities. The President fought for
    and signed legislation that would expand the Brady law to
    prohibit those convicted of any offense involving domestic
    violence -- misdemeanor or felony -- from owning or possessing
    a firearm.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Senator Dole has not displayed this same commitment
    during his 35 year congressional career. He voted against
    President Clinton�s 1994 Crime Bill which contained the
    Violence Against Women Act and funding for more local police to
    fight domestic violence. He also voted against the Brady Bill
    which makes it harder for domestic abusers to buy
    handguns.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>In 1980, Bob Dole voted against the Domestic Violence
    Prevention and Services Act -- which established a $65 million
    grant program for state, local and private efforts to prevent
    domestic violence and provide emergency shelter to battered
    women. At the time, Dole said, "the federal government has no
    business getting into the treatment of domestic ills of this
    nature..." (Congressional Record 8/26/80).</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Events will be held throughout the month, with most
    occuring October 11-14. Some of the events and participants
    include a roundtable at a women�s shelter in Nevada with
    Christopher Dodd, who is a Senator from Connecticut and
    chairman of the Democratic National Committee; an American
    College of Emergency Physicians conference in California; and a
    roundtable discussion on domestic violence with Gloria Steinem
    and other domestic violence prevention activists in
    Massachusetts.</tt></p>
