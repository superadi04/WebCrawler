<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE				
<BR>October 26, 1996						
				
<P>STATEMENT OF ANN LEWIS
<BR>DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER

<p>The Truth about Medicare Again:

<p>Once again Bob Dole and the Republican Party are ducking the truth about Medicare.  They are trying to run away from the facts about their record:

<P><b>Fact:</b>
	The Dole/Gingrich 1995 budget would have increased Medicare premiums $1,700 for an elderly couple by 2002 (based on CBO estimates).

<p><b>Fact:</b>	The current Dole tax scheme would require even deeper cuts in Medicare, so much of a reduction that Senator Dole’s campaign steering co-chair says he can’t talk about it during the campaign (Senator D’Amato on the Don Imus Show, 8/12/96).

<p>Maybe Bob Dole and Haley Barbour really think that a difference of $1,700 dollars a year is insignificant.  Maybe they don’t think it should matter to American families if Medicare premiums are doubled.  Maybe they want to spend the rest of this campaign talking about Medicare.  We’ll be happy to continue discussing the facts.
