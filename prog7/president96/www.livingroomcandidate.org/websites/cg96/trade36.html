              Texas is the country�s third largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $3.0 billion in
              agricultural exports abroad or 6.8% of the U.S. total
              in 1994 (latest year available for Department of
              Agriculture state export data). The largest export
              categories, cotton and linters and live animals and
              meat (excluding poultry), accounted for over 44
              percent of Texas� agricultural exports in 1994. Given
              the 22 percent increase in total U.S. agriculture
              exports in 1995, agriculture exports from Texas in
              1995 will likely range between $3.3 billion and $3.7
              billion.
