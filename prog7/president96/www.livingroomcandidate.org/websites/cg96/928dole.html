    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    September 28, 1996</tt>
    <p><tt>STATEMENT BY JOE LOCKHART<br>
    NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Just two days after the Census Bureau reported that the
    American economy is growing and that all Americans are sharing
    in the revitalized economy under President Clinton, Candidate
    Dole proved, once again, that he is out of touch with the
    American people and the economy.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Just this week, the Census Bureau reported that incomes
    rose faster last year than in any year in a decade, poverty
    fell more than any year since the 1960's, and income inequality
    declined by the most since 1968. For many Americans, this is
    further proof that America is on the right track and that Bob
    Dole just doesn�t get it.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>That Bob Dole would attempt to use the debates as an
    opportunity to scare the American people about the economy when
    even he said "the economy is the strongest it�s been in 30
    years," (Remarks to New Hampshire State Legislature, 2/13/96 --
    released by Dole Campaign 2/20/96) shows the desperation of his
    "Midnight in America" campaign.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The only threat to the economy is Bob Dole�s risky $548
    billion tax cut scheme which would blow a hole in the deficit
    and lead to even deeper cuts in Medicare and Medicaid than the
    1995 Dole/Gingrich budget.</tt></p>
