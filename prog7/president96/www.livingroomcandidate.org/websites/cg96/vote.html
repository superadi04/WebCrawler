    <tt>For Immediate Release<br>
    October 19, 1996</tt>
    <p><tt><b>WHY ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICANS SHOULD VOTE FOR PRESIDENT
    CLINTON</b></tt></p>
    <p><tt>On election day, November 5, 1996, Asian Pacific
    Americans will play a significant role in deciding the course
    of America�s future. The choice is strikingly clear. President
    Clinton has a proven record of accomplishments for Asian
    Pacific Americans. Asian Pacific Americans now have more jobs,
    more opportunity, less crime and stronger communities.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"President Clinton has greatly improved the lives of
    Asian Pacific Americans. He knows that Asian Pacific Americans
    play key roles in our communities and actively includes them in
    his Administration and campaign," said Alan Wheat, Deputy
    Campaign Manager and Director of Public Liaison. "Clearly,
    President Clinton is committed to Asian Pacific Americans,
    recognizes their incredible talents and understands the
    importance of their support. That�s why President Clinton has
    appointed more Asian Pacific Americans to his Administration
    than any previous Administration in history."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton's economic strategies have
    strengthened and expanded America�s economy. More than 10.5
    million new jobs have been created; the deficit has been cut by
    60%; interest rates have decreased on car loans and home
    mortgages; and we had the lowest unemployment in over six
    years. Our economy is on the right track and it is the
    strongest in years.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton also opened doors to higher education
    for more Americans by expanding student loans, Pell grants, and
    scholarships, and establishing Americorps, our national service
    program which gives young people the opportunity to earn money
    for college by serving their communities and their
    country.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The Clinton Administration has helped to strengthen and
    protect America�s families. President Clinton signed the Family
    and Medical Leave Act, giving working Americans the opportunity
    to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a newborn
    child or a sick family member without fear of losing their
    jobs.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"Economic prosperity, increased access to education, and
    a commitment to other Asian Pacific American issues are
    important to the community. President Clinton is leading
    America on the right track and will continue to help families
    in a second term. Our community must unite and work hard in the
    remaining days to get out the vote to reelect President Bill
    Clinton and Vice President Al Gore," said Sharon Singh,
    National Director of Asian Pacific American Outreach.</tt></p>
