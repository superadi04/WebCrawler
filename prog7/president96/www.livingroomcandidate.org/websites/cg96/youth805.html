<P>PRESS RELEASE
<BR>August 5, 1996


	<P>CLINTON/GORE '96 APPOINTS NEW ASSISTANT DIRECTOR 
<br>OF PUBLIC LIASON FOR YOUTH OUTREACH


<P>Sarah A. Lichtman has been appointed as the Clinton/Gore ‘96 campaign’s nationwide Assistant Director of Public Liaison for Youth Outreach.  Ms. Lichtman will work to ensure that the Clinton/Gore reelection campaign continues to reach young people on campuses and in communities everywhere.

<P>Ms. Lichtman, formerly the Political Outreach Director at College Democrats of America, trained and organized college students to be effective leaders.  "Her experience in youth outreach will be a tremendous asset for us all," said Alan Wheat, Deputy Campaign Manager and Director of Public Liaison.  "Sarah continually strives to improve youth leadership and get-out-the-vote efforts for young people.  She also has been instrumental in successfully implementing several voter registration campaigns." 

<P>President Clinton has worked to provide greater opportunities for our nation’s young people.  He signed into law the Student Loan Reform Act making college more affordable for 1.7 million students in 1994 and 1995 and has proposed a scholarship plan to make the first two years of college as universally available as high school.  The President’s new Direct Lending Program provides college students flexible repayment options.  He also created AmeriCorps, which has allowed 45,000 young people to serve in their communities these past two years while earning money for college.  The President expanded the School-to-Work Program for students who are not immediately bound for four-year colleges. 

<P>"Our young people deserve the best.  I am determined that they will get it.  We must work together to build the brightest, the best prepared, the most secure and the most successful generation of young people in the history of our nation," President Clinton said.
