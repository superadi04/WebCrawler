    <p><tt>PRESS RELEASE<br>
    September 8, 1996</tt></p>
    <p><tt>VETERANS CELEBRATE PRESIDENT CLINTON�S SOLID RECORD ON
    VETERANS� ISSUES</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton continues to reaffirm his commitment
    to the nation�s veterans, and, at the Democratic National
    Convention in Chicago, veterans celebrated his
    achievements.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"The Democratic convention stood in sharp contrast to
    the Republican convention. We spoke about substantive issues
    instead of giving breezy rhetoric and petty insults. We talked
    about a bridge to the future instead of one to the past. And we
    talked about the ways we can make this country better for all
    Americans, including veterans," said Tom Keefe, Clinton/Gore
    �96 National Director of Veterans Outreach.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>VA Secretary Jesse Brown and other prominent veterans in
    the Clinton Administration spoke to the convention delegate
    caucuses about how the President will continue his strong
    support of veterans as the nation moves into the 21st century.
    Secretary Brown�s speech at the convention set off an
    enthusiastic 10-minute floor demonstration as he compared the
    President�s record to that of the Republicans. And the
    Democratic platform commended President Clinton and Vice
    President Gore for fighting to protect the benefits that
    veterans have earned and pledged to continue President
    Clinton�s work for those veterans in the next four
    years.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Protecting and strengthening veterans� benefits is one
    of President Clinton�s highest priorities. Since he took
    office, he has revamped the VA health care system; promoted
    veterans� employment; extended benefits to veterans of the
    Persian Gulf and Vietnam Wars; and protected VA health care and
    hospital construction from over $1 billion in Republican
    cuts.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"I am proud to belong to a party that has demonstrated
    its unwavering commitment to our veterans again and again,"
    Keefe said. "Veterans across America can rest assured that
    President Clinton will continue to protect the benefits that
    they have earned"</tt></p>
