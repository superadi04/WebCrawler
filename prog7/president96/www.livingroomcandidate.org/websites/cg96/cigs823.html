    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    August 23, 1996</tt>
    <p><tt>STATEMENT BY JOE LOCKHART<br>
    NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole faces a big decision today -- Protect children
    or protect the tobacco lobby. Will Bob Dole stand with the
    President today in limiting tobacco sales to America's children
    or will he stand with his friends in the tobacco lobby who have
    done so much for his campaigns over the years?</tt></p>
    <p><tt>If history is a guide, the prospects of standing up for
    children are dim. Bob Dole has said that cigarette smoking is
    not necessarily addictive. Dole even went as far as to compare
    the dangers of cigarette smoking to those of drinking a glass
    of milk.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Irresponsible rhetoric aside, Bob Dole has consistently
    blocked President Clinton's efforts to give parents and
    communities the tools to protect children. Bob Dole voted
    against the expansion of the Safe and Drug Free School program
    in 1994 and tried to cut funding in half in 1995. Dole voted
    against zero tolerance for students who bring guns into schools
    and opposed President's plan to put 100,000 additional cops on
    the street. Bob Dole even voted against the creation of the
    Drug Office in 1982.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole has an opportunity today to stand up for
    children and support the President's efforts to restrict
    tobacco sales to children. Unfortunately, Bob Dole's 35 year
    record in Washington indicates that he will again be with the
    tobacco lobby.<br></tt></p>
