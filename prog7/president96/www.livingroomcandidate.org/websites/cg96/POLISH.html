    <p><tt>POLISH AMERICAN LEADERS FORM</tt></p>
    <p><tt>NATIONAL CLINTON/GORE �96 STEERING COMMITTEE</tt></p>
    <p><tt>CHICAGO -- The Clinton/Gore campaign today announced the
    formation of "Polish Americans for Clinton/Gore" at a news
    conference in Chicago, Illinois. Clinton/Gore Ethnic Outreach
    Director Ilir Zherka joined Polish American leaders to kick off
    the committee.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Members of the committee are distinguished Polish
    American leaders from Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland,
    Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. These
    leaders will develop state steering committees in an effort to
    increase voter support for reelecting President Clinton and
    Vice President Gore. With only 28 days left until election day,
    "Polish Americans for Clinton/Gore �96" will focus on the
    following activities:</tt></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>*Informing the Polish American community of the
      President�s accomplishments;<br>
      *Identifying voters in the community; and<br>
      *Rallying Polish Americans behind the reelection of the
      President.</tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><tt>"I am happy that Polish American leaders from across the
    country have joined together to support my reelection," said
    President Bill Clinton. "Their support demonstrates our
    commitment to help Poland build its democracy, to expand NATO,
    and to strengthen American families and protect our
    communities. With the help of these leaders, I am hopeful we
    will carry the day on November 5."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Attached is a list of the committee members, and a list
    of the President Clinton�s accomplishments on issues of concern
