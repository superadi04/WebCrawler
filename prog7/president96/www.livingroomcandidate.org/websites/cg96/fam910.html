    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    September 10, 1996</tt>
    <p><tt>STATEMENT BY JOE LOCKHART<br>
    NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"This family leave act is heralded by the President as
    one of the great milestones of his first term.... But my view
    is, why should the federal government be getting into family
    leave?" Bob Dole (New York Times, 9/8/96)</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole is continuing his assault on America�s
    families. He led the fight against Family Medical Leave in the
    Senate and now opposes the President�s proposed expansion of
    the law to allow parents time off to attend to family
    needs.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>It�s no wonder that most Americans believe that the
    President shares their values. (Labor Day USA Today/CNN/Gallup
    poll)</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole is stubbornly standing alone against America�s
    families and businesses. The Family and Medical Leave Act is
    one of President Clinton�s most successful initiatives to help
    working families. Twelve million families have benefited from
    guaranteed time off in times of family emergencies. And nine
    out of ten businesses surveyed found the Family and Medical
    Leave Act did not adversely affect their companies.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Today, Bob Dole�s advisors said that he�s going to shift
    his focus to moral issues. Bob Dole may talk about family
    values, but he clearly doesn�t value America�s
    families.</tt></p>

    <p><tt><b>1996: Campaigning On His Opposition To Family
    Leave:</b><br></tt></p>In 1996, despite its proven
    effectiveness, Dole continues to oppose the Family and Medical
    Leave Act. On September 7, 1996, at a campaign speech, Dole
    said:
    <p><tt>"This family leave act is heralded by the President as
    one of the great milestones of his first term....But my view
    is, why should the federal government be getting into family
    leave? It ought to be left to employees or the states or the
    counties, and the federal government ought to be out of it."
    [New York Times, 9/8/96]</tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>1996: Dole Opposes Expansion Of Family & Medical
    Leave:</b><br>
    Dole also opposed expansion of the Family and Medical Leave Act
    that would allow parents time off to get medical attention for
    children, or for family duties such as attending a child's
    school play or accompanying an elderly relative to medical
    appointments. Dole said:</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"It ought to be left to the employees, or the state or
    the county -- the federal government ought to be out of it."

    In 1993, Dole voted against Senate passage of the Family and
    Medical Leave Act (S. 5), after leading a filibuster against

    1993 (p. 391; vote #7, p. 2-S); Congressional Record, 1993

    mandatory..." -- Bob Dole speaking on an amendment he offered
