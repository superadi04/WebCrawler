      <tt>FIRST LADY HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON KICKS OFF<br>
      DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS DAY</tt>
      <p><tt>41 STATES HOLD ACTIVITIES TO HIGHLIGHT IMPACT<br>
      OF PRESIDENT CLINTON�S ANTI-DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAWS</tt></p>
    </center>
    <p><tt>First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton today kicked off the
    Clinton/Gore campaign�s Domestic Violence Awareness Day on
    October 12 by participating in a news conference call in
    Minnesota that also featured Paul Wellstone, who is a Senator
    from Minnesota, and his wife Sheila Wellstone.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The conference call was designed to bring attention to
    the serious issue of domestic violence in America and to
    highlight the remarkable accomplishments the Clinton
    Administration has made in domestic violence prevention. Press
    activities are being held in 41 states for Domestic Violence
    Awareness Day. These activities will bring together advocates,
    24-hour hotline beneficiaries, grant recipients under the
    Violence Against Women Act and COPS program, business leaders,
    union leaders, and political leaders from around the
    nation.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>In speaking about the importance of Domestic Violence
    Awareness Day, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said, "One of
    the reasons people should be focused on this election is
    because we need a government that is responsive to the needs of
    the people. Domestic violence was never taken seriously before.
    Now, many of the people who are leading safer and healthier
    lives, many of the victims who have been helped, many of the
    perpetrators who are no longer able to abuse and violate women
    and children and may have even learned the error of their ways,
    are doing so now because we have made a concerted national
    effort against domestic violence."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The President has officially proclaimed October National
    Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Across the nation, local
    organizations are holding conferences, vigils, and other events
    to increase awareness and build unity around this disturbing
    issue. Millions of women and children throughout our nation are
    plagued by the terror of family violence each year, and
    approximately 20 percent of all hospital emergency room visits
    by women result from such violence. As many as three million
    children witness violence in their homes each year. It is only
    by stopping violence at home that we will ultimately end
    violence in the streets.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"By holding press activities nationwide on October 12,
    the campaign hopes to underscore the Administration�s
    commitment to -- and turn a national spotlight on -- efforts to
    end domestic violence," said Clinton/Gore Campaign Manager
    Peter S. Knight.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The President has an unprecedented record on combating
    domestic violence:</tt></p>
    <ul type="circle">
      <li><tt>President Clinton signed the Violence Against Women
      Act (VAWA) into law, which is providing $156 million to
      strengthen the criminal justice system�s response to crimes
      of violence against women.</tt></li>
      <li><tt>President Clinton created a 24-hour Domestic Violence
      Hotline, 1-800-799-SAFE, which has already provided immediate
      crisis intervention, counseling and referrals for over 42,000
      women.</tt></li>
      <li><tt>The Administration allocated $46 million under the
      Community Oriented Policing program (COPS) to help law
      enforcement counter domestic violence.</tt></li>
      <li><tt>The President created the Violence Against Women
      Office in the Department of Justice to lead a national effort
      to combine tough new federal laws with help for states and
      localities.</tt></li>
      <li><tt>The President fought for and signed legislation that
      would expand the Brady law to prohibit those convicted of any
      offense involving domestic violence -- misdemeanor or felony
      -- from owning or possessing a firearm.</tt></li>
    </ul>
    <p><tt>Senator Dole has not displayed this same commitment
    during his 35 year congressional career. He voted against
    President Clinton�s 1994 Crime Bill which contained the
    Violence Against Women Act and funding for more local police to
    fight domestic violence. He also voted against the Brady Bill
    which makes it harder for domestic abusers to buy
    handguns.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>In 1980, Bob Dole voted against the Domestic Violence
    Prevention and Services Act -- which established a $65 million
    grant program for state, local and private efforts to prevent
    domestic violence and provide emergency shelter to battered
    women. At the time, Dole said, "the federal government has no
    business getting into the treatment of domestic ills of this
    nature..." (Congressional Record 8/26/80).</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Events will be held throughout the month, with most
    occurring October 11-14. Some of the events and participants
    include a round table at a women�s shelter in Nevada with
    Christopher Dodd, who is a Senator from Connecticut and
    chairman of the Democratic National Committee; an American
    College of Emergency Physicians conference in California; and a
    round table discussion on domestic violence with Gloria Steinem
    and other domestic violence prevention activists in
    Massachusetts.</tt></p>
