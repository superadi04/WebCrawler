          <p>My web site lists many of President Clinton’s
          accomplishments while refuting Republican economic
          predictions and the Dole election bid in general. I
          launched the site in order to counter negative remarks
          about the President found on the Internet.</p>
          <p>I live in Los Angeles, and I'm 60 years old. I changed
          my on-line name to Tarja (from Ethel) so that younger web
          users would be attracted to the site as well. Here's a
          quote from the What We’re About section of my site: “[The
          President] undoubtably knows he’d get more political
          payoff by helping bankers instead of students or by
          lowering the taxes of late-night comics instead of the
          taxes of low-income workers. But as a man of character,
          he does the right thing anyway.”<br></p>

          <p>My name is Marty Gallanter. I'm an ex-New Yorker
          living in rural Minnesota. One day, I went to hear the
          President and Vice President speak at the National Rural
          Conference at the Univeristy of Iowa. Once there, I found
          that the two men I had only experienced through TV
          screens and newspaper articles became real, living people
          that cared deeply about rural America. I wrote up an
          editorial which is posted on my web site, and also want
          to share his story with Clinton/Gore supporters.</p>
          <p>Here's an excerpt: “I expected the President to open
          the conference and leave. He didn't. He chaired it
          personally for over five hours and when his voice began
          to fade, the Vice-President took over. The huge briefing
          books set down by the aides for the President and
          Vice-President were never opened. Both men carried on
          extensive and complex discussions supported entirely by
          the knowledge they carried in their heads.”<br></p>

          <p>I've created a web site with five major speeches of
          the President including photographs and quotes. I chose
          the speeches because they embody American values the
          President stands for: tolerance, free speech, religious
          freedom, civil rights and national community. President
          Clinton will be remembered for his values and I'm helping
          keep his words in the public domain through my site.</p>

          cannot have one without the other.”</p>
