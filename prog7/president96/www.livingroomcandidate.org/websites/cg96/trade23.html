              Iowa is the country�s fifth largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $2.4 billion in
              agricultural exports abroad or 5.4% of the U.S. total
              in 1994 (latest year available for Department of
              Agriculture state export data). The largest export
              categories, soybean and feed grains, accounted for
              over 65 percent of Iowa�s agricultural exports in
              1994. Given the 22 percent increase in total U.S.
              agriculture exports in 1995, agriculture exports from
              Iowa in 1995 will likely range between $2.7 billion
              and $2.9 billion.
