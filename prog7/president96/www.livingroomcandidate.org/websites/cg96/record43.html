            A Growing Economy: Unemployment in New Mexico has
            dropped: 7.5% to 7.1%. Our nation now has the lowest
            combined rate of unemployment, inflation, and mortgage
            rates since 1968. Consumer confidence is at its highest
            level in six years, real wages are rising for the first
            time in a decade, and homeownership is at a 15-year
            high.

            during the previous four years; 10.5 million jobs
            created nationally. Because President Clinton signed
            the minimum wage increase, 35,000 workers in New Mexico
            received a pay raise. Over the next two years 62,000

            take 12 weeks of unpaid leave for the birth of a child
            or to take care of a sick family member without fear of
            losing their jobs. Teen pregnancy is falling, the
            poverty rate is decreasing, the number of people on
            welfare is declining. In New Mexico alone 5,744 fewer
            people are on welfare and 4,812 fewer are on food
            stamps. Tougher child support enforcement collects
            nearly $8 million more -- an increase of 41% since FY
            1992.

            nationwide. President Clinton provided over 8,405 New

            and community policing are working. Our nation’s crime
            rate is down. The number of murders reported has
            dropped 8%—one of the largest declines in three
            decades. In New Mexico alone the crime rate has dropped
