              Kentucky is the country�s 19th largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $771 million in
              agricultural exports abroad or 1.8% of the U.S. total
              in 1994 (latest year available for Department of
              Agriculture state export data). The largest export
              categories, tobacco, and live animals and meat
              (excluding poultry), accounted for over half of
              Kentucky�s agricultural exports in 1994. Given the 22
              percent increase in total U.S. agriculture exports in
              1995, agriculture exports from Kentucky in 1995 will
              likely range between $900 million and $950 million.
