    <p><tt>Press Release<br>
    September 18, 1996</tt></p>
    <p><tt>PRESIDENT CLINTON�S CRIME INITIATIVES HELPING AFRICAN
    AMERICANS</tt></p>
    <p><tt>WASHINGTON -- Comparing the crime record between
    President Bill Clinton and Bob Dole reveals a startling fact to
    African Americans: President Clinton wins by a knockout. In
    just four years in office, President Clinton has done more to
    help reduce crime in the African American community, than Bob
    Dole has done in 35 years as a Washington politician.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Under President Clinton, violent crime rates have gone
    down each and every year. In 1995, murder dropped by 8%, and
    robbery dropped by 7%. In addition, violent criminals are
    serving longer prison sentences. The average prison sentence
    for fire-arm related and violent crimes was 74.5 months in
    1992. In the first two years under President Clinton, the
    prison sentence for the same offenders was 88 months - more
    than a year longer.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton continues to be in the forefront of
    helping to reduce crime in African American communities. The
    President�s 1994 Crime Bill, amongst other things,
    included:<br>
    * Adding 100,000 community police officers, of which 44,000
    have been funded.<br>
    * Creating the Community Schools Program, thus providing
    constructive alternatives for young people<br>
    * Banning assault weapons.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>In addition, the President is strengthening the Safe &
    Drug Free Schools program, enabling 97% of our nation�s school
    district to help keep violence, drugs, and alcohol away from
    students; and increasing penalties for drug dealers who sell
    drugs to children or use children to sell drugs..</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"The President�s crime initiatives have meant more
    community policing, more crime prevention programs, and more
    creative ideas to reduce crime in our schools" said Harold
    Gist, Director of African American outreach for Clinton/Gore
    �96.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole�s weak record on crime includes:<br>
    * Voting against the President�s Crime Bill<br>
    * Voting against the Brady Bill & the assault weapons ban<br>
    * Voting to cut Safe & Drug Free Schools Program by nearly
    half</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"The record is clear, President Clinton is the real
    champion of African Americans when it comes to reducing crime.
    Bob Dole, meanwhile, is all talk," said Alan Wheat, Deputy
    Campaign Manager and Director of Public Liaison for
    Clinton/Gore �96.</tt></p>
