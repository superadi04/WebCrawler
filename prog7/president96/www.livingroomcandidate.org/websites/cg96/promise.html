    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    October 1, 1996</tt>
    <p><tt>STATEMENT BY JOE LOCKHART<br>
    NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY</tt></p>
    <p><tt>When it comes to questionable campaign promises, nothing
    would give consumers buyer�s remorse more than Bob Dole�s risky
    $548 billion tax cut.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole�s plan, according to 546 prominent economists,
    including seven Nobel Laureates, is "not credible" and its
    impact "would be a lowering of future living standards."
    (Letter released by the Economic Policy Insitute 9/24/96).
    Other top economists and journalists declared that Bob Dole�s
    economic plan could cause drastic cuts of over 40 percent in
    Medicare, Medicaid, and other initiatives that protect and
    improve the quality of life of the American people.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Americans test-drove the 1995 Dole/Gingrich budget model
    and rejected it as a lemon. If Dole wants to offer new insights
    to consumers, he can begin by saying what he will cut to pay
    for his 1996 massive tax cut scheme.</tt></p>
