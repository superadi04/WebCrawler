      <tt><b>NEW MEXICO AD AGENCY TO FILM PRESIDENT
      CLINTON</b></tt>

    <p><tt>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- An Albuquerque Hispanic advertising
    agency will go to Texas today, September 27, to film President
    Clinton during his campaign stops in Ft. Worth and
    Houston.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>A. Gutierrez & Associates, Inc., the agency selected by
    the Clinton/Gore ï¿½96 General Committee to promote its national
    Hispanic Outreach campaign, will send a film crew to follow the
    President during campaign stops in Texas. The goal is to get
    footage of the President in a Southwestern setting and, in
    particular, within the Hispanic community, to be used in
    television and print advertisements to run throughout the
    country.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Armando Gutierrez, who is president of the agency, said
    that he was pleased to have been selected to handle Hispanic
    outreach efforts. "Hispanics have historically been one of the
    most loyal segments of the Democratic Party. This effort makes
    clear that neither the Party nor the President is taking us for
    granted. Our campaign will include television, radio and print
    advertising."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The footage to be shot by Gutierrez & Associates will be
    used in television and print ads to begin running nationally in
    the next few weeks. J. Wiscovitch Associates, Ltd., a New York
    Puerto Rican agency, will handle creative plans for the East
    Coast under a subcontract agreement with Gutierrez.</tt></p>
