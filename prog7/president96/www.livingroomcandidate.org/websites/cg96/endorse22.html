    <p><tt>For Immediate Release:<br>
    October 30, 1996</tt></p>
    <center>
      <tt><b>MORE THAN 500 SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS ENDORSE
      CLINTON/GORE</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>WASHINGTON -- More than 500 U.S. scientists and
    engineers -- including 12 Nobel Laureates -- from 41 states and
    the District of Columbia today announced their support for the
    reelection of President Clinton and Vice President Gore. Their
    endorsements affirm the ongoing support of the nation�s leading
    technical professionals for the Clinton Administration�s vision
    of science and technology as America approaches the 21st
    century.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>In a speech in Philadelphia yesterday, President Clinton
    thanked the hundreds of scientists and engineers who have
    supported the Administration�s goals in science and technology
    �by pushing the frontiers of science.� The President also
    acknowledged the role that David Farber, an Honorary Co-Chair
    of �Scientists & Engineers for Clinton/Gore� and the Director
    of the Distributed Systems Laboratory at the University of
    Pennsylvania, played in the development of the Internet -- a
    key link in future communication, educational, and medical
    technology.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>William Julius Wilson, who is a professor of sociology
    at Harvard University and another Honorary Co-chair, attributes
    the willingness of the scientific and engineering community to
    support the Democratic candidates to a widespread recognition
    of the consequences of a Dole presidency on U.S. science and
    the nation�s economy. Wilson said �The Dole economic plan could
    reduce federal non-defense R&amp;D spending by at least 40
    percent. Such a reduction would devastate a national research
    infrastructure that has taken 50 years to develop and is the
    envy of the world.�</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The endorsements were made by the scientists and
    engineers in their individual capacities and are not
    endorsements of the organizations for which they work. The list
    is available upon request.</tt></p>
