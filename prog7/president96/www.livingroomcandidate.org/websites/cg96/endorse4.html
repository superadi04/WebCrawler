      <tt><b>AGRICULTURE LEADERS FROM 18 STATES ENDORSE<br>
      RE-ELECTION OF PRESIDENT CLINTON AND VICE PRESIDENT
      GORE</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>Agriculture officials from 18 states today announced
    their full support for the re-election of President Clinton and
    Vice President Gore at a news conference at the National Press
    Club in Washington, D.C.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"We are thrilled to have the endorsement of prominent
    leaders in the agriculture community," said Peter S. Knight,
    Clinton/Gore �96 Campaign Manager. "This constitutes a strong
    validation of President Clinton�s sensible approach to
    agriculture."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The officials pointed to Clinton Administration
    accomplishments and the President�s sound approach to rural
    issues as the reason for their endorsement.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"The Administration said they would make life better for
    farmers, and they have," said Bob Odom who is the Louisiana
    Agriculture Commissioner. "Income is higher, prices are better,
    exports are growing, and rural home ownership is up. In every
    case," added Odom, "the President has listened to our concerns
    and helped implement new approaches to solving the problems of
    rural America."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Agriculture officials from Delaware, Florida, Georgia,
    Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland,
    Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North
    Dakota, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia pledged
    their support for the President.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"One of the key accomplishments during President
    Clinton�s first term was the restructuring of the U.S.
    Department of Agriculture," said Jim Graham who is the North
    Carolina Agriculture Commissioner. The USDA has led federal
    reinvention with the most massive restructuring in our history.
    The Clinton Administration�s plan for reorganizing USDA has
    already saved taxpayers over $900 million and cut staff by
    10,000 positions. Added Bruce Andrews who is the Oregon
    Commissioner, "The new farm bill represents a historic, much
    needed change in the way U.S. agriculture competes at home and
    in the international marketplace."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Attached is a list of state agriculture officials
    endorsing the President and Vice President.</tt></p>
