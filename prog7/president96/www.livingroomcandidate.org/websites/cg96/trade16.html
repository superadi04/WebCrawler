              Michigan is the country�s 17th largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $836 million in
              agricultural exports abroad or 1.9 percent of the
              U.S. total in 1994 (latest year available for
              Department of Agriculture state export data).
              Michigan�s largest agriculture export categories,
              feed grains, soybeans, and vegetables, accounted for
              more than one-half of Michigan�s agricultural exports
              in 1994. Given the 22 percent increase in total U.S.
              agriculture exports in 1995, agriculture exports from
              Michigan in 1995 will likely range between $0.9
              billion and $1.1 billion.
