    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    October 9, 1996<br></tt>
    <p><tt>AMERICA'S GROWING ECONOMY IS GOOD FOR WORKING
    FAMILIES</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Washington-- On October 7, more than 2,500 CEO�s from
    around the nation personally endorsed the re-election of
    President Clinton and Vice President Gore. Praising President
    Clinton�s leadership in putting the economy "on the right
    track," the business leaders endorsed President Clinton�s
    economic plan that has reduced the deficit, invested in the
    American people, and moved the country�s economy in the right
    direction.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The coalition of business leaders will continue to build
    support for President Clinton and Vice President Gore. Steven
    Rattner, who is Managing Director of the investment firm Lazard
    Freres & Co., pointed to the success of "Wall Street and Main
    Street" businesses under President Clinton as the reason for
    the enthusiastic response to the coalition�s work. "Wall Street
    has seen the economy make remarkable progress in the past four
    years under President Clinton. The stock market continues to
    set new records, more than 10.5 million new jobs have been
    created, and we are creating whole new industries in areas such
    as information and technology."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>America�s strong economic growth has helped working
    families across the nation. When President Clinton took office,
    America�s economy was drifting. The deficit was skyrocketing,
    unemployment was high, and job growth was anemic. Four years
    after President Clinton took office, America�s economy is on
    the right track to the 21st century. The President's plan has
    led to the creation of 10.5 million new jobs, 93 percent in the
    private sector. Basic industries have rebounded, with 931,000
    new construction jobs and nearly 120,000 new manufacturing
    jobs. Currently, America has the lowest combined rate of
    unemployment, inflation, and mortgage rates since 1968.
    Consumer confidence is at its highest level in six
    years.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The growing economy is giving families greater
    opportunities to provide for their children: American family
    income is up $1,600 since passage of President Clinton's 1993
    Economic Plan, real hourly wages are rising for the first time
    in a decade and home ownership is at a 15-year high.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton is committed to balancing the budget
    while providing targeted tax cuts for education, child-rearing,
    and home buying, which strengthens the economy. The President
    will continue working to open foreign markets to American goods
    and increase the economic and personal security of working
    Americans.</tt></p>
