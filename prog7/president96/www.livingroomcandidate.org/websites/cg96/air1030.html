      <tt><b>TRANSCRIPT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON�S FREE AIR TIME
      REMARKS</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt><i>President Clinton�s remarks will be broadcast this
    evening, October 30, 1996, on the following stations: CNN,
    C-SPAN, NOSTALGIA TELEVISION, NPR, PBS and UPN.</i></tt></p>
    <p><tt>Throughout these televised forums, the American people
    have seen two very different visions of how to lead our country
    into the 21st century. Do we work together, to help people have
    the tools they need to make the most of their own lives? Or do
    we leave people to fend for themselves? Do we build a bridge
    together to a brighter future -- or a bridge to the
    past?</tt></p>
    <p><tt>That choice is very important. And that is why I urge
    every American to participate on Election Day.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>After all, it�s your vote which will decide whether we
    balance the budget while protecting Medicare, Medicaid,
    education, and the environment.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Your vote will decide whether we give our children the
    education that is the key to opportunity, and higher-paying
    jobs -- whether we help every child learn to read, and log onto
    the vast new world of the Internet, and meet the highest
    standards of excellence. Whether everyone who wants to go to
    college has the chance to go. Whether we even have a Department
    of Education to stand up for America�s children.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Your vote will decide whether we make our families
    stronger -- with better, more affordable health care; the tools
    to succeed both at home and at work; and children that grow up
    free from gangs and guns, drugs and tobacco.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Your vote will decide whether we keep the Brady Bill and
    keep guns out of the hands of felons, fugitives, and stalkers.
    Whether we keep the ban on deadly assault weapons -- and keep
    putting 100,000 police on our streets, all across
    America.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>This is the last presidential election of the 20th
    century. But in many ways, it is our first discussion of how we
    move forward, into the 21st century. I believe more than ever
    that our best days are still ahead of us. And if we work
    together -- if we cast that vote for our future -- we can build
    a bridge to the 21st century that is wide enough and strong
    enough for all of us to cross.</tt></p>
