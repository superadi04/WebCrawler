    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    October 5, 1996</tt>
    <p><tt><b>TRANSCRIPT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON�S FREE AIR TIME
    REMARKS ON THE FOX NETWORK</b></tt></p>
    <p><tt>QUESTION: America�s young people believe they are more
    apt to encounter an alien than receive Social Security in their
    lifetime. What will you do to make sure Social Security is
    still there for young people�s future?</tt></p>
    <p><tt>PRESIDENT CLINTON: Social Security and Medicare speak to
    our most fundamental values: honoring our parents. Protecting
    our families. Rewarding work. That�s why my commitment to
    Social Security and Medicare is unwavering.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>We do need to strengthen Social Security. But the trust
    fund is solvent well into the next century. We should take
    advantage of that time and address this issue in a thoughtful,
    bipartisan way just as we did in 1983, when a bipartisan
    commission made changes that protected Social Security into the
    21st century with broad support from seniors.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>What I will never do is accept a budget that undercuts
    our commitment to our parents. Last year, when Republicans in
    Congress passed a plan that cut $270 billion from Medicare, I
    vetoed it. When they shut the government down to force me to
    sign it, I still said no. My balanced budget plan saves
    Medicare instead of undermining it. We�ve also protected 40
    million private pensions, and made pensions more portable and
    available to small business people.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Our children deserve the same security and retirement
    that our parents have and by working together, reaching beyond
    politics, we can give it to them.</tt></p>
