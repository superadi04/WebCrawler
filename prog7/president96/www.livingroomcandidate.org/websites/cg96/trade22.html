              Arkansas is the country�s 10th largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $1.2 billion in
              agricultural exports abroad or 2.8% of the U.S. total
              in 1994 (latest year available for Department of
              Agriculture state export data). The four largest
              export categories, Rice, Soybeans, Poultry, and
              Cotton, accounted for 84 percent of Arkansas�
              agricultural exports in 1994. Given the 22 percent
              increase in total U.S. agriculture exports in 1995,
              agriculture exports from the state of Arkansas in
              1995 will likely range between $1.4 billion and 1.5
              billion.
