    <b>President Clinton recognizes that America�s thriving economy
    begins with our smallest businesses.</b>
    <p>Small businesses employ 53 percent of American workers,
    contribute 47 percent of sales, and account for over half of
    the Gross Domestic Product.</p>
    <p>The President understands that it takes courage to start
    something new, to carve a reality out of a dream — often with
    few resources, sometimes in difficult surroundings — and in an
    economy that demands much of its participants. President
    Clinton has fought to improve the economic security of small
    businesses. The President will continue to nurture and support
    the powerful economic engine of the small business sector
    through policies of fiscal responsibility and wise investment.
