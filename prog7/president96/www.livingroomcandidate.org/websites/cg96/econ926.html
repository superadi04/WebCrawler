<BR>PRESS RELEASE
<BR>September 26, 1996


<P>STATEMENT BY JOE LOCKHART
<BR>NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY

<P>Bob Dole says the economy is in the tank, there is no consumer confidence and household incomes are falling.  Recent statistics show the economy growing at 4.8 percent, consumer confidence at a six year high and today’s census report shows the largest increase in household incomes in a decade.

<P>With this track record for predictions, it might be time for Bob Dole to find a new issue.

<P>While Bob Dole continues his negative attacks on the economy, President Clinton is working to build on our economic success with targeted tax cuts and a balanced budget.

<P>Here are just some of the highlights form the 1995 census report:
