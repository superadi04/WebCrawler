    PRESS RELEASE</tt>
    <p><tt><b>STATEMENT BY JOE LOCKHART<br>
    NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY</b></tt></p>
    <p><tt>The last time Bob Dole went to Illinois to talk about
    domestic violence, he was lectured by a woman attending the
    event. Our statement remains the same. Please see
    attached.</tt></p>

      <tt>PRESS RELEASE</tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>For Immediate Release:<br>
    July 23, 1996</tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>STATEMENT BY ANN LEWIS DEPUTY CAMPAIGN
    MANAGER</b></tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>Bob Dole�s Record On Protecting Women From Domestic
    Violence:<br>
    It Is Bob Dole Who Has Questions To Answer</b></tt></p>
    <p><tt>Call it the "gender gap" blues. Press accounts have
    repeatedly mentioned that Bob Dole is personally bothered by
    the fact that he is trailing President Clinton among American
    women.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>This frustration is the only explanation for Bob Dole�s
    ridiculous and unfounded charge today.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>But Bob Dole has no one to blame but himself.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>American women are supporting President Clinton because
    they have seen the President work hard to address their
    concerns and improve their safety.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The President�s record on protecting women from violence
    is strong. He signed the Violence Against Women Act into law as
    part of the 1994 Anti-Crime Bill. The President�s program to
    put 100,000 additional police on the street included $20
    million specifically designated for local domestic violence
    programs.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>At virtually every turn over the last 3 years, Bob Dole
    and his partner Newt Gingrich opposed the President�s efforts
    for their own narrow partisan reasons. They voted "NO" on the
    Violence Against Women Act and the 1994 Anti-Crime Bill. They
    voted "NO" on funding local domestic violence programs. And
    they voted "NO" on keeping handguns out of the wrong
    hands.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>If it were up to Bob Dole, there would be no domestic
    violence hotline. Bob Dole�s opposition to this important
    program is consistent with his 35 year record in Washington. In
    1980, for example, Dole voted against a $65 million grant
    program to prevent domestic violence and provide emergency
    shelter for battered women.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>It is Bob Dole who will have to answer for his partisan
    opposition to sensible actions taken by President Clinton to
    protect American women from violence.</tt></p>

      <tt><b>The Dole Record On Domestic Violence: Opposing Efforts
      To Protect Women From Violence And Domestic Abuse</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt><i>Senator Dole has opposed, filibustered and voted
    against President Clinton�s efforts to provide more protections
    for American women.</i></tt></p>
    <p><tt>The Violence Against Women Act -- Senator Dole Voted
    No:<br>
    Dole bragged about "leading" passage of Violence Against Women
    Act. In May 1996, Dole spoke to a group of Republican women in
    Washington, DC claiming that among the reasons that women
    should support his presidential campaign was the fact that his
    record included, "leading the Senate to fully fund -- for the
    first time -- the Violence Against Women Act". [CNN,
    5/8/96]</tt></p>
    <p><tt>However, Dole voted against the Violence Against Women
    Act -- and referred to it as "pork." On<br>
    August 14, 1994, Dole discussed his opposition to President
    Clinton�s Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of
    1994. Dole said the bill contained "pork" social spending. Dole
    then led opposition to the Crime Bill and eventually voted
    against it. After the Crime Bill passed -- despite Dole�s
    filibustering and threatening to kill the bill -- Dole referred
    to the "$10 billion worth of pork" in the Crime Bill. Included
    in the $10 billion in so-called "pork" was the $1.8 billion in
    funding for the Violence Against Women Act. [NBC "Meet The
    Press," 8/14/95; Washington Post, 8/15/94; LA Times, 8/12/94;
    Dole speech, Denver Colorado, CSPAN, Campaign �94; 1994 CQ
    Almanac, Votes # 294, 295, p. 50-S]</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Opposition To Action On Domestic Violence Is Not New To
    Bob Dole�s Long Career. Opposition<br>
    to federal action against domestic violence is not new to Bob
    Dole�s 35 year congressional career. Sixteen years ago in 1980,
    Bob Dole voted against the Domestic Violence Prevention and
    Services Act sponsored by Sen. Alan Cranston (D-CA). The act
    established a $65 million grant program for state, local and
    private efforts to prevent domestic violence and provide
    emergency shelter to victims. Republican senators eventually
    killed the bill with a threatened filibuster. [1980 CQ Almanac,
    p. 443-445, vote #382, 9/4/80; DPC, Senate Vote Report, 1980,
    vote # 390]</tt></p>
    <p><tt>More Local Police To Fight Abuse Against Women --
    Senator Dole Voted No:<br>
    Why did Bob Dole vote against investing $20 million in local
    police department programs to combat domestic violence? When
    Bob Dole filibustered and voted against President Clinton�s
    1994 anti-crime bill, he voted against putting 100,000 new
    police officers on America�s streets through the Community
    Oriented Policing (COPS) program. And in 1995, Dole voted to
    eliminate funding for the COPS program altogether. Among the
    COPS programs the President�s initiative created was the
    Community Oriented Policing to Combat Domestic Violence program
    -- which makes $20 million available to local police
    departments that apply community policing techniques to fight
    domestic violence. [Department Of Health And Human Services,
    Reuters, 8/24/94; CQ Almanac, 1994 (50-S); Congressional
    Record, 12/7/95 (Vote # 591; CQ, 12/9/95)]</tt></p>
