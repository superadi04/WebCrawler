<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE				
<BR>October 26, 1996						

<p><b>President Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Tipper Gore Kick Off  
<br>"National Clinton/Gore ‘96 Get Out the Women’s Vote Weekend," 
<br>Activities Scheduled in 15 States</b>



	<p>The Clinton/Gore Campaign announced today that it will celebrate "National Clinton/Gore ‘96 Get Out the Women’s Vote Weekend" on October 26 and October 27, 1996.  To celebrate the weekend activities, President Clinton will speak at a Clinton/Gore "Get Out the Women’s Vote" rally at Lee High School Park in Springfield, Virginia on Sunday, October 27.   Hillary Rodham Clinton is scheduled to address a Clinton/Gore rally on Sunday at the Garden State Park Pavilion in Cherry Hill, New Jersey and Tipper Gore will apeak at a "Women’s Vote" rally in Chattanooga, Tennessee on Monday, October 28.

	<p>Throughout the weekend thousands of women from across the nation will participate in Clinton/Gore GOTV events designed to generate enthusiasm and mobilize women to vote for the Clinton/Gore ticket. 

	<p>"Your vote clearly made the difference in 1992, and I hope you will cast your vote for me again in 1996,"  President Clinton told a group of women at a recent event.  "The choice women make on November 5 will determine our country’s direction for the next four years, and the future of issues that really matter, such as education, crime, health care and the environment."

	<p>Other Clinton/Gore GOTV events scheduled for this weekend include organized state-wide literature drops to "soccer moms" across Arkansas and Vermont; phone banking to prospective women voters in New Mexico and North Carolina; and teams of 2100 women campaigning in counties throughout Georgia and Pennsylvania.

	<p>"There is a great deal at stake in this election," said Hillary Rodham Clinton.  "It is not only the last presidential election of this century, but more importantly it will define how our children and grandchildren will live in the 21st century."  

	<p>President Clinton has an unprecedented record of helping women and their families.  Since taking office in 1993, President Clinton hasn’t stopped campaigning for the women’s vote.  Among other things, he has signed the Family and Medical Leave Act, increased funding for breast cancer research, increased small business loans to women by 86 percent, and sponsored the Violence Against Women Act.

	<p>According to Ann Lewis, Clinton/Gore Deputy Campaign Manager, 54 million eligible women voters did not go to the polls in 1994.  "By holding ‘Get Out the Vote’ events on October 26 and October 27, the campaign hopes to underscore the Administration’s efforts to support women and to encourage women to go to the polls on November 5," said Lewis.

	<p>Similar efforts to highlight the importance of women voting are being organized by state Democratic Coordinated Campaigns, including events in Florida and Oklahoma.
