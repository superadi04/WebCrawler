    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    October 24, 1996</tt>
    <center>
      <tt><b>VICE PRESIDENT GORE, FIRST LADY HILLARY CLINTON KICK
      OFF<br>
      "NATIONAL EDUCATION DAY"<br>
      Activities Held in 30 States</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Vice President Al Gore and First
    Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined thousands of educators
    across the country to celebrate the Clinton/Gore campaign�s
    "National Education Day." Vice President Gore addressed the
    Wisconsin Education Association Council in Madison, Wisconsin.
    The First Lady spoke before students at Ohio University in
    Athens, Ohio.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Companion press activities were held in 30 states. They
    brought together parents, students, and teachers to highlight
    the President�s ongoing efforts to improve education and to
    outline the choice millions of voters will make on November
    5th.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Vice President Gore spoke of these efforts, "President
    Clinton and I believe that one of the most important tasks we
    can accomplish is to improve our nation�s education. That is
    why we expanded Head Start and the Pell Grant program. That is
    why the President signed the Goals 2000 program. We are fully
    committed to ensuring that our nation�s children get the best
    education that America can offer."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The First Lady spoke about the integral link between
    education and a prosperous America. "A strong America begins
    with education. The President and Vice President are continuing
    to build on polices that will strengthen our education system
    so that millions of young people will succeed as we move into
    the 21st Century."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Mickey Ibarra, Senior Advisor and Director of Special
    Projects for the Clinton/Gore Campaign, pointed out the stark
    differences between President Clinton and Bob Dole on the issue
    of education. "President Clinton has implemented initiatives
    that are not only making our schools safer, but have made
    learning easier and more affordable for millions of students
    and parents. In stark contrast, Bob Dole�s plan to improve
    education is to eliminate the Department of Education," he
    said.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Events around the country include a March for the Future
    in Pennsylvania, rallies in Idaho, Minnesota and New Jersey,
    and press conferences in New York, Alabama, and Kansas.
    Attached is the list of state activities.</tt></p>
