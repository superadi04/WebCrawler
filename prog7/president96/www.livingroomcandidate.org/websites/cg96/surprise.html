<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE				
<BR>October 19, 1996						
				
<P>STATEMENT OF JOE LOCKHART
<BR>NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY

<P>Today is yet another anniversary of Bob Dole’s votes against America’s working families.  October 19, 1995, Bob Dole voted in committee to allow employers to raid their employees’ pension funds.  Then, Bob Dole voted against requiring companies to include in their taxable income any of the pension fund they took out of the employee plan. [Senate Committee on Finance, Senate vote #8349, 10/19/95; Senate Committee on Finance, Senate vote #8336, 10/19/95]   One month later, Dole voted for the Dole-Gingrich budget which would have allowed companies to take $15 billion out of pension funds -- affecting nearly 4 million workers. [Congressional Quarterly, 11/25/95, p.3613, vote #584, 11/17/95; PBGC Facts Sheet, 4/96]

	<P>Bob Dole says he "understands the problems" of working America.  Doesn’t he believe Americans need the security of their pensions?  Doesn’t Bob Dole recognize employees’ rights as an issue?  Well, Bob Dole’s "word is his bond" and his vote is his record.  Bob Dole’s record does not support working Americans.
