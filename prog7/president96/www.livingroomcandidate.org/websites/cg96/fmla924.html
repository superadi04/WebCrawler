    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    September 24, 1996</tt>
    <p><tt>BACKGROUND ON THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT</tt></p>
    <p><tt><i>"The Family and Medical Leave Law... allows parents
    time off for birth or adoption of a child, or for family
    emergencies, without fear that they will lose their jobs.
    Already it has helped 12 million families -- and it hasn�t hurt
    the economy one bit. Bill and I are fortunate that our jobs
    have allowed us to take breaks from work, not only when Chelsea
    was born but to attend her school events and take her to the
    doctor. But millions of other parents can�t get time
    off.</i></tt></p>
    <p><tt><i>"That�s why my husband wants to expand the Family and
    Medical Leave Law so that parents can take time off for their
    doctors appointments and parent-teacher
    conferences."</i></tt></p>
    <p><tt>-- Hillary Rodham Clinton<br>
    Democratic National Convention<br>
    August 27, 1996</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Family and Medical Leave ensures that working families
    don�t have to choose between the jobs they need and the
    families they love. Because of family and medical leave,
    working families do not face losing their jobs at the time when
    they need them most -- when they have newborn or newly adopted
    children, when they need to care for seriously ill children,
    spouses, or parents, and when they need to recover from their
    own serious illnesses.</tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>Family and Medical Leave has helped millions of
    American working families.</b></tt></p>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>Since President Clinton signed the Family and Medical
      Leave Act, employees across America have taken over 12
      million job-protected leaves.</tt></li>
      <li><tt>67 million eligible employees can rely on the Family
      and Medical Leave Act if and when they need its
      protections.</tt></li>
      <li><tt>People from all walks of life, from all across the
      country, from every political, religious, and ethnic group
      have used Family and Medical Leave. Working women and men
      have taken Family and Medical Leave; fully 42% of
      leave-takers are men.</tt></li>
      <li><tt>Connecticut is a leading proponent of family leave
      legislation, having passed a state law in 1989. A total of
      670,000 workers are eligible for family leave in Connecticut
      under the national Family and Medical Leave Act.</tt></li>
    </ul>
    <p><tt><b>Family and Medical Leave has not created significant
    costs or burdens on business; it has even <i>improved</i>
    productivity at some companies.</b></tt></p>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>The vast majority of employers covered by the Family
      and Medical Leave Act have experienced no or only small
      increases in administrative and related costs because of
      it.</tt></li>
      <li><tt>More than three quarters of covered employers have
      found it very or somewhat easy to coordinate Family and
      Medical Leave benefits and laws, determine coverage and
      eligibility, and maintain required records.</tt></li>
      <li><tt>Many employers have found that Family and Medical
      Leave actually saves them money in reduced turnover and
      enhanced employee productivity.</tt></li>
    </ul>
    <p><tt><b>President�s Clinton�s vision: to help working
    families who need family and medical leave even
    more.</b></tt></p>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>Two out of five working Americans anticipate needing
      family and medical leave over the next five years.</tt></li>
      <li><tt>But Family and Medical Leave isn�t available when
      parents need to go to parent-teacher conferences, or to take
      their children or other family members to the doctor for
      regular medical appointments.</tt></li>
      <li><tt>President Clinton has proposed expanding the Family
      and Medical Leave Act to allow working parents that extra
      flexibility through an additional 24 hours of leave a year
      for parent-teacher conferences and preventive
      check-ups.</tt></li>
      <li><tt>Bob Dole <i>opposes</i> even this modest expansion.
      He says he doesn�t believe the federal government should help
      working families in this way.</tt></li>
    </ul>
    <p><tt>Today Clinton-Gore �96 is highlighting the law
    nationwide. Four years ago on this same date, then-Republican
    Leader Bob Dole cast his vote to uphold President Bush�s veto
    of the Family and Medical Leave Act. Forty-four events are
    taking place across the country to highlight President
    Clinton�s commitment to America�s working families.</tt></p>
