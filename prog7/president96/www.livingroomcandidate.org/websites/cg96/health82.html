    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    August 23, 1996</tt>
    <p><tt>PRESIDENT CLINTON SIGNS HISTORIC HEALTH CARE REFORM
    LEGISLATION</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Keeping his promise to millions of uninsured Americans,
    President Clinton today signed into law the Kassebaum-Kennedy
    Health Insurance Reform Act of 1996, which limits the ability
    of insurers to exclude from coverage those individuals who are
    sick or disabled. This legislation also provides a guarantee of
    ongoing coverage for millions of Americans who leave or lose
    their jobs.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton is extremely pleased to secure this
    long-overdue victory. He appreciates the bipartisan
    Congressional response to his State of the Union Address
    calling for the passage of this legislation.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>As many as 25 million Americans will benefit from the
    important portability guarantees -- guaranteed renewal and
    guaranteed issue -- within the health insurance reform
    provisions.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Although health insurance reform is the focus of this
    legislation, the Kassebaum-Kennedy Health Insurance Reform Act
    of 1996 includes numerous other provisions advocated by
    President Clinton. For example:</tt></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>Preventing fraud and abuse. The Kassebaum-Kennedy
      legislation strengthens the efforts of the federal government
      to target and prosecute "bad apple" health care providers who
      are bilking the system of billions of dollars.</tt></p>
      <p><tt>Tax deductibility of health insurance premiums for the
      self-employed. With regard to the tax deductibility of health
      insurance premiums, the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation moves
      toward assuring that the self-employed are treated the same
      as all other employers who purchase health
      insurance.</tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><tt>President Clinton remains committed to seeking other
    ways to address other problems in the health care system. This
    legislation represents an important part of his agenda for
    increased access to the health care system..<br></tt></p>
