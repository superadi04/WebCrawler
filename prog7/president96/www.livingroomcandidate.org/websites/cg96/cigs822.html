    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    August 22, 1996</tt>
    <p><tt>STATEMENT BY JOE LOCKHART<br>
    NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole�s latest opposition to efforts to restrict
    tobacco sales to children, labeling the FDA regulations a
    "campaign gimmick", is consistent with his repeated opposition
    to the President�s efforts to fight drug abuse among
    teenagers.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole voted against the creation of the President�s
    Safe and Drug Free School program in 1994. In 1995, Bob Dole
    then voted to cut the program by 51%. Bob Dole also led the
    filibuster against legislation that would impose tougher
    sentence for school-yard drug dealers. This year, the
    Republican congress proposed cutting $767 million from the Drug
    Control Budget and rejected a $15 million Youth Drug Awareness
    mass media campaign.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>First, Bob Dole opposed the President�s Safe and Drug
    Free School Program. Then Bob Dole sent the message that
    tobacco wasn�t necessarily addictive. Now, Bob Dole says FDA
    regulations to restrict tobacco sales to children are a
    campaign gimmick.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole is demonstrating the difference between
    following and leading. Bob Dole seems more interested in
    protecting the tobacco lobby than protecting children.
    President Clinton is standing up for the interests of
    children.<br></tt></p>
