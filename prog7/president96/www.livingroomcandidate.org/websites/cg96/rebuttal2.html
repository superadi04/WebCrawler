    <br>
    <b>ECONOMIC GROWTH</b>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> Under President Clinton, the private
    sector of the economy has grown 3.2 percent per year -- and
    that�s a stronger record of private-sector growth than either
    the Reagan (3.0%) or Bush (1.3%) Administrations. [Based on
    data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis] The conservative
    business magazine Barron�s concluded that President Clinton had
    a stronger economic record than any Republican Administration
    in the post-World War II era. Bob Dole himself said that �It is
    also true, as some have said, that our economy is the strongest
    it�s been in 30 years.� [Bob Dole Remarks to the New Hampshire
    Legislature, 2/13/96, Dole Campaign Release 2/20/96; Barron�s,
    3/18/96] <a name="2" id="2"></a></p>
    <p><b>DOLE TAX PLAN</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> Independent experts say that Dole�s $548
    billion plan would actually raise taxes on roughly nine million
    working families by cutting the Earned Income Tax Credit
    [EITC]. Citizens for Tax Justice found that: �8.9 million
    low-and moderate-income working families would face tax
    increases averaging $270 each under the Dole plan, due to its
    proposed reductions in the earned-income tax credit.� [Citizens
    for Tax Justice, 8/26/96]. U.S. News and World Report confirmed
    this fact. [U.S. News and World Report, 8/19/96]. By contrast,
    President Clinton remains committed to maintaining the EITC; by
    expanding it in 1993, he cut taxes for 15 million families.
    [Treasury Office of Tax Policy, 4/96] In 1995, Jack Kemp
    labeled such cuts in the earned income tax credit -- proposed
    in the Dole/Gingrich 1995 budget: a �tax increase on the poor,
    and it is unconscionable.� [Jack Kemp, testimony to the Senate
    Small Business Committee, 10/19/95] <a name="3" id="3"></a></p>
    <p><b>SUPPLY SIDE ECONOMICS</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> Contrary to this supply-side myth, after
    Reagan's 1981 tax cut, real personal income tax revenues fell
    for three consecutive years. They did not recover to their 1981
    level until 1986, even though the economy was in recovery.
    [Dept. of the Treasury] This loss of income tax revenue helped
    explode the deficit. The only revenues that went up were from
    Social Security taxes, owing to increases in the payroll tax
    rates in 1981, 1982, 1984, 1985 and 1986. [Dept. of the
    Treasury] From 1980 to 1986 -- when the Republicans controlled
    the White House and the Senate -- the deficit nearly tripled,
    increasing from $74 billion in FY80 to $221 billion in FY86.
    [CBO, 5/96] <a name="4" id="4"></a></p>
    <p><b>EMPOWERMENT ZONES</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> During Secretary Kemp�s tenure at HUD, no
    Empowerment Zones were created. Clinton-Gore didn't talk about
    creating empowerment zones and economic communities, we created
    105 of them, and they're working. (Source: Office of Personnel
    Management, Monthly Report of Federal Civilian Employment,
    SF113-A) The Best Kept Secrets in Government, Report of the
    National Performance Review, September 1996. Page 53.</p>
    <p>Contrary to Jack Kemp's assertion, Los Angeles was
    designated as a supplemental Empowerment Zone receiving $115
    million in federal grants and $315 million in HUD loan
    guarantees.(LA Times, May 26, 1996) <a name="5" id="5"></a></p>
    <p><b>WELFARE</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> President Clinton promised to end welfare
    as we know it, and this August he signed a bill to do just
    that. Even before that, the Clinton Administration had moved
    aggressively to approve welfare reform demonstrations in 43
    states -- putting 75 percent of all welfare recipients in the
    nation under time limits, work requirements, and new measures
    designed to increase parental responsibility. The President
    made child support a high priority, increasing collections by
    nearly 50 percent from 1992 to 1996; persuaded Congress to
    expand the Earned Income Tax Credit to reward work over
    welfare; and created 10 million new jobs. As a result, welfare
    rolls dropped by 1.9 million people between January 1993 and
    July 1996. [ July 1996 �flash report,� Administration for
    Children and Families, Department of Health and Human Services]

    <p><b>EDUCATION</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> Bob Dole has a 35-year record of voting
    against education. In 1964 he voted against the creation of
    Head Start [CQ Almanac, 1964], in 1965 he was 1 of only 63
    representatives to vote against the creation of the federal
    student loan program [CQ Almanac, 1965 (vote #169), 10/25/65],
    and in 1979 he voted against the creation of the Education
    Department [Senate vote #1070, 4/30/79]. In 1995, he teamed up
    with Newt Gingrich to write the most anti-education budget in
    history, which would have cut education and training by $31
    billion [FY96 budget resolution conference agreement; CBO
    analysis of the HR 2491, 11/6/95], and voted to cut student
    loans [CQ Almanac, 1995, vote #231]. <a name="7" id=
    "7"></a></p>
    <p><b>CLINTON/GORE TAX CUT PROPOSALS</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> The �social engineering� to which Kemp
    refers are actually targeted tax cuts for working families that
    are fully paid for under the President�s balanced budget. These
    tax cuts help families prepare for the greatest financial
    challenges of their lives: a $1,500 refundable tax credit for
    the first two years of college tuition; a $10,000 tuition tax
    deduction for education and training at any age; a $500 tax
    credit for children under 13 years of age; expanded IRAs for
    education, retirement, major medical expenses, or first time
    home ownership; an elimination of capital gains taxes for the
    sales of most homes. [OMB, Mid-session Budget Review, 7/96;
    Dem. Convention Policy Announcements, 8/29/96]. <a name="8" id=
    "8"></a></p>
    <p><b>SOCIAL SECURITY</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> Kemp voted against Dole�s 1983 Social
    Security plan -- and attacked Dole in the 1988 Republican
    primaries for his plan: "George Bush and Bob Dole voted to
    freeze Social Security and raise taxes on Social Security
    recipients. What saved Social Security was not the tax
    increase, Bob, it was getting inflation down, it was getting
    inflation down and getting the economy moving." [Kemp, 1/16/88
    GOP primary debate; 1983 CQ Almanac, p. 18-H, vote #43; p.
    12-S, vote #54] <a name="9" id="9"></a></p>
    <p><b>MEDICARE</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> Under the Dole-Gingrich plan to cut
    Medicare by $270 billion, Medicare would have spent $1,400 less
    per person in 2002 than it will without these cuts. This would
    lower spending per person to more than 20% below private sector
    premium growth rates. [Administration estimates based on CBO
    assumptions of private sector premium growth rates, August
    1995; CBO, �The Economic and Budget Outlook,� p.84;
    Administration estimates based off of CBO March 1995 baseline]
    At the same time, their plan would raise premiums $1,700 more
    per couple over 7 years and by $269 per couple in 1996 alone.
    [Administration estimates based on CBO 12/13/95
    assumptions]</p>
    <p>Senator Dole doesn�t believe in Medicare. He said: �I was
    there, fighting the fight, one of twelve, voting against
    Medicare in 1965 . . . because we knew it wouldn�t work.�
    [American Conservative Union Speech, 10/24/95] Dole mislead
    seniors and other voters about the secret Republican plan to
    cut Medicare just before the 1994 elections. Dole said:
    �They�re falsely accusing Republicans of secret plans to cut
    Social Security and Medicare benefits. [Dole radio response,
    Federal News Service, 11/5/95] Then Dole tried to cut Medicare
    by $270 billion. [Congressional Record, 11/17/95, vote number
    584] In August of this year, Dole�s campaign chariman admitted
    Dole would have to cut Medicare under his plan. D�Amato said:
    �You�re gonna have to look at Medicare. . . I would never say
    it if I were [Dole] until after the election. [Don Imus Show,
    8/12/96] <a name="10" id="10"></a></p>
    <p><b>MEXICO</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> The U.S. Treasury has earned profits of
    almost $500 million resulting from Mexican interest payments.
    Monthly Report by Secretary of the Treasury Pursuant to Mexican
    Debt Disclosure Act of 1995, September, 1996; Washington Post,
    7/26/96. In January, 1995, Bob Dole agreed with Bill Clinton
    that we needed to stabilize the Mexican economy in the wake of
    the peso crisis. Statement of President and Congressional
    leadership, 1/12/95. Bill Clinton�s plan worked: inflation
    continues to come down in Mexico, and Mexico has repaid nearly
    three-quarters of its loans well ahead of schedule -- $9
    billion out of $12.5 billion. <a name="11" id="11"></a></p>
    <p><b>CUTTING GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> From 1986 to 1993, the volume of federal
    regulations grew by 10,000 pages [Office of Information and
    Regulatory Affairs, 10/96] The Clinton-Gore Administration is
    cutting them by 16,000 pages. Under the Vice President�s
    National Performance Review, the growth in new regulations that
    took place when Sec. Kemp was running HUD has been reversed.
    The Small Business Administration has cut its loan application
    form from one inch to one page. [NPR Report, 9/96] And HUD has
    eliminated 1,782 pages of regulations that it inherited from
    Secretary Kemp. [OIRA, 8/31/96] In July 1995, Dole lead the
    fight to weaken meat inspection. [Congressional Quarterly,
    7/15/95, p. 2050; vote #302, p. 2098] New York Times, in an
    editorial said �The so-called regulatory reform bill offered by
    the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, could...delay the start
    of modern meat and poultry inspection.� [6/22/95] <a name="12"
    id="12"></a></p>
    <p><b>HAITI</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> Our goal was restoration of democracy -- a
    goal established by Secretary of State Jim Baker. Washington
    Post, 10/3/91. Before democracy was restored, over 2,000
    refugees a month were coming to our shores; the refugee flow is
    now virtually zero. Before democracy was restored, there were
    3,000 political murders over 3 years; since democracy was
    restored, political murders have dropped significantly -- to
    about two dozen. The human rights group Human Rights Watch said
    that �Haitians no longer face the systematic human rights
    abuses committed by the military� junta that ousted Aristide.

    Comm., 9/27/96; Human Rights Watch Press Release, 10/14/95.</p>
