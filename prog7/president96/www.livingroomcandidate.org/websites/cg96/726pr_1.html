    PRESS RELEASE<br></tt>
    <p><tt>On July 24, 1996, Mr. Bill Anoatubby, Governor of the
    Chickasaw Nation in Oklahoma, became the first Tribal Leader to
    endorse President Clinton. At a formal endorsement ceremony at
    Clinton/Gore '96 Headquarters, Governor Anoatubby met with
    Campaign Manager Peter Knight and Deputy Campaign Managers Alan
    Wheat, Ann Lewis and Craig Smith.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"I was anxious to do this as the President has supported
    Tribal interests nationwide since his election in 1992. Four
    years ago, I was the first Tribal Leader to endorse the
    President, and I am pleased to be the first in 1996," said
    Governor Anoatubby.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"I am honored to have the support of the Governor. Since
    I took office, my Administration has worked in partnership with
    Tribal Leaders like Governor Anoatubby to protect Native
    American religious freedom, promote tribal self-determination,
    preserve tribal natural resources and provide economic
    opportunities for Native Americans. I look forward to
    continuing this government-to-government relationship in order
    to build on the progress we have made for Indian
    country."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The Chickasaw Nation, like other Federally recognized
    American Indian Tribes, has a government-to-government
    relationship with the United States, though Tribal members are
    U.S. citizens. The Chickasaw Nation has 35,000 members and is
    represented in Washington, D.C. by Ambassador Charles
    Blackwell.</tt></p>
