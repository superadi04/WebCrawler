            rate of unemployment, inflation, and mortgage rates
            since 1968. Consumer confidence is at its highest level
            in six years, real wages are rising for the first time

            losing their jobs. Teen pregnancy is falling, the
            poverty rate is decreasing, and the number of people on
            welfare is declining. In Indiana, 66,162 fewer people
            on welfare and 48,352 fewer on food stamps. In
            addition, tougher child support enforcement collects
            nearly $50 million more -- an increase of 40% since FY
            1992.
