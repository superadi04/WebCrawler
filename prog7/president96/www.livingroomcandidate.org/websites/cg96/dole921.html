    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    September 21, 1996</tt>
    <p><tt>STATEMENT BY JOE LOCKHART<br>
    NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole�s idea of health care reform is promoting the
    politics of gridlock by making sure nothing gets done. As
    Senate Majority Leader, Bob Dole could not pass a single piece
    of significant health care reform legislation.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Now that Bob Dole is no longer in the Senate the entire
    landscape has changed. The Kennedy Kassebaum bill, held hostage
    by Bob Dole�s special interest friends, is now the law. And
    this week, Congress passed significant legislation on hospital
    stays for new mothers and extending coverage for mental
    health.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole as Senate Majority Leader gave us gridlock, in
    fact, Bob Dole introduced the word "gridlock" into the
    political dictionary. Without Bob Dole blocking health care
    reform, America is benefiting from significant reforms that are
    extending important benefits to all Americans.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The lesson of 1994 was health care reform must move
    forward on an incremental basis. The lesson of 1996 is by
    removing the guru of gridlock, Bob Dole, health care reform is
    a reality.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>America�s health cannot afford a return to the Dole
    politics of gridlock, special interest favors and
    partisanship.</tt></p>
