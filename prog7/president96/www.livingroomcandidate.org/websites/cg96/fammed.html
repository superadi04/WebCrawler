    <p><tt>For Immediate Release<br>
    September 28, 1996</tt></p>
    <center>
      <tt><b>THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT:<br>
      A RECORD OF SUCCESS FOR ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICANS</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>President Clinton�s Family and Medical Leave Act
    continues to be a winner for Asian Pacific Americans. Thanks to
    the law, millions of workers have been able to take time off
    from work to care for a sick family member without fear of
    losing their jobs.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Since President Clinton signed the Family and Medical
    Leave Act, employees across America have taken over 12 million
    job-protected leaves. In addition, 67 million eligible
    employees can rely on the Family and Medical Leave Act if and
    when they need its protection.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Besides being family-friendly, the Family and Medical
    Leave Act has not created significant costs or burdens on
    businesses; it has even improved productivity at some
    companies. The vast majority of employers covered by the law
    experienced no or only slight increases in administrative
    costs. In fact, many employers have found the law beneficial,
    contributing to increased productivity and reduced
    turnover.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"Obviously President Clinton�s top priority is
    families," said Alan Wheat, Deputy Campaign Manager and
    Director of Public Liaison. "President Clinton values what
    Asian Pacific Americans have valued for generations —
    strengthening families and providing better opportunities for
    our children."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton has proposed expanding the Family and
    Medical Leave Act to allow working parents extra flexibility
    through an additional 24 hours of leave a year for
    parent-teacher conferences and preventive medical
    check-ups.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole, on the other hand, is opposed to the law. He
    voted against it while in the Senate and is against expanding
    the law as outlined by President Clinton.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"Clearly, President Clinton has led the way in
    protecting our families and children. Parents do not have to
    fear losing their jobs if they have a family emergency and must
    tend to a child�s illness," said Sharon Singh, National
    Director for Asian Pacific American Outreach. "President
    Clinton understands that it is our basic duty to safeguard our
    families and children. Strong and healthy families are
    essential in building a solid economy for the 21st
    century."</tt></p>
