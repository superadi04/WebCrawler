              Ohio is the country�s 12th largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $1.1 billion in
              agricultural exports abroad or 2.6% of the U.S. total
              in 1994 (latest year available for Department of
              Agriculture state export data). The largest export
              categories, soybeans and feed grains, accounted for
              over 70 percent of Ohio�s agricultural exports in
              1994. Given the 22 percent increase in total U.S.
              agriculture exports in 1995, agriculture exports from
              Ohio in 1995 will likely range between $1.2 billion
              and $1.4 billion.
