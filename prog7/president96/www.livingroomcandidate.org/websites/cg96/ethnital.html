    �96,� the Clinton-Gore campaign announced today.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Upon meeting with the Italian American leaders,
    President Clinton said: �The Italian American heritage of faith
    in God, love of family, respect for and commitment to hard work
    and education exemplifies the enduring American values that
    will help us as a nation build a bridge to the 21st
    Century.�</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The Italian American leaders endorsed President Clinton
    and Vice President Gore�s reelection. They cited the
    Administration�s strong support for educational opportunity for
    the young and secure retirement for senior citizens, as well as
    the President�s innovative leadership against crime and for
    welfare reform that requires work, but protects children. They
    also noted the President�s successful drive to lower interest
    rates for home owners and small business owners, to include
    Italian Americans at all levels of the Administration, and to
    maintain strong cooperative relations with Italy.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>�Italian Americans make up a large portion of the voter
    population in key contested states,� said Ilir Zherka, Ethnic
    Outreach Director. �The active support of this distinguished
    group of Italian American leaders is a big boost for President
    Clinton�s campaign.�</tt></p>

    �96 include Geraldine Ferraro, who is a former Representative
    from New York and a former Democratic vice-presidential
    candidate; Patrick Zambon Leahy, who is a Senator from Vermont,
