  <blockquote>
    <p>Mahaffey Theater<br>
    St. Petersburg, FL</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome Jack Kemp and Vice
    President Al Gore.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Good evening from the Mahaffey Theater in St.
    Petersburg, Florida. I am Jim Lehrer of The Newshour on PBS.
    Welcome to the 1996 Vice Presidential Debate between Vice
    President Al Gore, the Democratic nominee, and Jack Kemp, the
    Republican nominee.</p>
    <p>This event is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential
    Debates, the rules and format, as drawn and agreed to by the
    two campaigns, are almost identical to those of the
    presidential debate last Sunday night in Hartford.</p>
    <p>It is 90 minutes long. The candidates are not permitted to
    question each other directly. I will ask the questions with no
    limitations on the subjects. There will be a 90-second answer,
    a 60-second rebuttal and a 30-second response to each
    question.</p>
    <p>And with the help of some lights, I will help the candidates
    abide by those time limits. The order for everything was
    determined by a coin toss. There will be three minute closing
    statements, but no opening statements.</p>
    <p>So we go now to the first question and to Mr. Kemp. Some
    supporters of Senator Dole have expressed disappointment over
    his unwillingness in Hartford Sunday night to draw personal and
    ethical differences between him and President Clinton. How do
    you feel about it?</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: Wow. In 90 seconds? I can't clear my throat in 90
    seconds. Jim, Bob Dole and myself do not see Al Gore and Bill
    Clinton as our enemy. We see them as our opponents. This is the
    greatest democracy in the world. People are watching not only
    throughout this country but all over the world as to how this
    democracy can function with civility and respect and decency
    and integrity.</p>
    <p>Bob Dole is one of those men who served the United States
    Senate, his public life is a public record.</p>
    <p>He fought on the battlefield. He has worked with Democrats
    and Republicans. In my opinion, it is beneath Bob Dole to go
    after anyone personally.</p>
    <p>Clearly, Abraham Lincoln put it best when he said you serve
    your party best by serving the nation first. And I can't think
    of a better way of serving this nation in 1996 than by electing
    Bob Dole as President of the United States of America.</p>
    <p>These issues are fully capable of being understood and
    reflected upon by the American people. This is a democracy in
    which we have the freest press and the greatest First Amendment
    rights in the history of mankind.</p>
    <p>Bob and I respect that. These issues will be aired, but they
    will be aired with dignity and respect and ultimately leave it
    to the American people to make up their minds about who should
    be the leader of this country in the 21st Century.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. Vice President.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: Thank you, Mr. Lehrer. I would like to
    thank the people of St. Petersburg for being wonderful hosts.
    My family and I are glad to be here.</p>
    <p>I would like to thank Jack Kemp for the answer he just gave.
    I think we have an opportunity tonight to have a positive
    debate about this country's future. I'd like to start by
    offering you a deal, Jack. If you won't use any football
    stories, I won't tell any of my warm and humorous stories about
    chlorofluorocarbon abatement.</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: It's a deal. I can't even pronounce it.</p>
    <p>(Laughter)</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: What I do want to talk about tonight is
    Bill Clinton's positive plan for America's future. We have a
    plan to balance the budget while protecting Medicare, Medicaid,
    education and the environment, creating millions of new jobs,
    including one million new jobs in America's inner cities. I am
    excited about the chance to talk about this plan and even more
    excited about the chance to work on it if you, the people of
    this country, will give Bill Clinton the means and privilege of
    doing so for four more years.</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: I have really only two differences with Bill
    Clinton, President Clinton, Vice President Gore, foreign policy
    and domestic policy. Our foreign policy is ambivalent,
    confusing. It is sending strong signals to the wrong people and
    we have learned over the years that weakness is provocative.
    The domestic economy is not doing what it can do, this
    President believes we are at our capacity, Bob Dole and I
    believe we can do a lot better. It is about the potential of
    the American people to lift themselves up and not have their
    lives controlled by the United States Government in
    Washington.</p>
    <p>Mr. Vice President.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: What do you see as the political philosophy
    differences in a general way, Mr. Vice President, between you
    and President Clinton, on the one hand, Mr. Kemp and Senator
    Dole on the other?</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: The differences are very clear. We have
    a positive plan based on three principles. We want to provide
    opportunity for all Americans. We insist on responsibility
    being accepted, in turn, by everyone and we want to strengthen
    our communities and their ability to support families and
    individuals in our common effort to create a bright future.</p>
    <p>Here is how we plan to do that: We have a balanced budget
    plan that has targeted tax cuts for middle-income families. We
    have already given tax cuts to 15 million of the hardest
    pressed working families in America.</p>
    <p>Our plan for the next four years features a $1,500 tax
    credit called a HOPE scholarship for tuition at community
    college, junior college or college.</p>
    <p>A $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition for those who go
    further, so that in essence, no American family will ever be
    taxed on the money they spend for college tuition.</p>
    <p>Also, tax relief for first-time home buyers. Tax
    encouragement for savings and help in paying health care
    expenses and a tax break, actually, the elimination of capital
    gains taxes on the profits from the sale of a home.</p>
    <p>All of this is within a balanced budget plan which protects
    Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: Jim, this economy is overtaxed, overregulated, and
    too many people suing each other, too much litigation. Our
    education is not up to the standards that the American family
    and the American people want for their children, and clearly
    the welfare system is a disgrace to our Judeo-Christian
    principles. It is not the values of the poor that should be
    called into question. It is the values of the welfare system
    from Washington and that prevent people from climbing out of
    poverty.</p>
    <p>Our biggest debate with this administration on domestic
    policy is that they think we are at our fullest capacity, we
    have reached our potential and that 2.5 percent growth is
    enough for America. Frankly, that's just not good enough for
    this country.</p>
    <p>We cannot just run the clock out on the 20th century.
    Clearly we need to lower the tax rate across the board on
    working, saving and investing. I know my friend Al will suggest
    that is trickle-down economics. Well, Al, if it is trickle-down
    economics, ask Van Woods, a young entrepreneur who owns a
    restaurant in Harlem. He said he would hire 60 more people if
    we would cut the capital gains tax.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER Mr. Vice President?</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: I talked about our positive agenda for
    the future a moment ago. Your original question was about the
    contrast. The plan from Senator Dole and Mr. Kemp is a risky,
    $550 billion tax scheme that actually raises taxes on 9 million
    of the hardest pressed working families. It would blow a hole
    in the deficit, cause much deeper cuts in Medicare, Medicaid,
    education and the environment and knock our economy off track,
    raising interest rates, mortgage rates and car payments.</p>
    <p>We stopped that plan before. We will stop it again. We want
    a positive plan for growth and more jobs.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. Kemp, back to the philosophy question. Do
    you think there is a basic philosophy difference between these
    two tickets or is it about specifics which both of you have
    talked about?</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: Well, this is a perfect example. Bob Dole and I
    want to cut the tax rates across the board on each and every
    American working, saving, investing and taking risks in
    America.</p>
    <p>All wealth is created suspect all growth is generated by
    risk taking entrepreneurs. The tax rate on capital in America
    is way too high. It is too high on the family. And it is
    particularly too high on working men and women.</p>
    <p>The average family in America at the median level of income
    is spending 25 to 26 percent of their income sent to the
    Federal Government. That's more than shelter, food, clothing
    and energy. That's just not right.</p>
    <p>When I was growing up in Los Angeles, my parents were one
    working family, one bread winner per family was all that was
    necessary. Now, if a woman wants to go to work or a man wants
    to go to work, it ought to be their choice, not the choice of
    the Washington, D.C. establishment.</p>
    <p>Bill Clinton, the President, and Al Gore suggest that they
    will give us a tax cut, but only if we do exactly what they
    want us to do. That isn't America. That's social engineering.
    The tax code should reflect our values in a Judeo-Christian
    sense, work, honesty, integrity, contracts, property and
    investment and savings should be rewarded and Bob Dole and Jack
    Kemp are not only going to cut the tax rates across the board
    and lower the capital gains tax, I will be glad to talk about
    it a little bit later because there isn�t time, we are going to
    repeal the 83-year-old code and replace the 7.5 million words
    and that will take this country roaring into the 21st
    century.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: This risky tax scheme would blow a hole
    in the deficit. You don't have to take my word for it. Time,
    Newsweek, U.S. News and World Report, Business Week, 83 percent
    of hundreds of economists in a random survey just recently, all
    said it would blow a hole in the deficit.</p>
    <p>There is another feature that I would like to hear Mr. Kemp
    speak about.</p>
    <p>Just before he joined Senator Dole on the ticket, he said
    that the part of the plan that raises taxes on 9 million of the
    hardest working families in America was unconscionable. That
    means it is wrong and it shouldn't happen.</p>
    <p>I agree it is still part of the plan. We believe that taxes
    should not be increased on those families. We have a plan to
    cut taxes on middle-income families within a balanced budget
    plan, eliminating the deficit and protecting Medicare,
    Medicaid, education and the environment.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. Kemp?</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: Every time this country in the 20th century has
    cut tax rates across the board, revenues went up. The economy
    grew. And I am surprised at this point in his career that Vice
    President Gore and the President cannot understand that you get
    more revenue from a bigger buy and clearly, creating more jobs,
    reduces the social welfare drain, clearly makes more
    opportunity for capital to be invested in our inner cities.</p>
    <p>Frankly, Al, we shouldn't just tinker with the capital gains
    tax. We should eliminate it in the inner cities of America to
    put capital to work to make democratic capitalism and jobs
    available in our inner cities of the United States.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. Vice President, should Federal Government
    affirmative action programs be continued?</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: Yes. President Clinton addressed this
    issue when he said: �Mend it; don't end it�. Diversity is a
    great strength in America. Look around the world at other
    places where they have not paid attention to the necessity of
    promoting harmony between different ethnic, racial and
    religious and cultural groups.</p>
    <p>We ought to be very proud in our country, as most Americans
    are, that we have made tremendous progress, but we ought to
    recognize that we have more work to do.</p>
    <p>Now, the first thing that we are trying to do is to create a
    million new jobs in the inner cities of this country with tax
    credits for employers who hire people who are now unemployed.
    We are seeking to have vigorous enforcement of the laws that
    bar discrimination.</p>
    <p>Now, I want to congratulate Mr. Kemp for being a lonely
    voice in the Republican Party over the years on this question.
    It is with some sadness that I refer to the fact that the day
    after he joined Senator Dole's ticket, he announced that he was
    changing his position and was thereafter going to adopt Senator
    Dole's position to end all affirmative action.</p>
    <p>That's not good for our country. Bill Clinton and I believe
    that the United States of America has its brightest days ahead,
    and we will see them even brighter if we promote diversity and
    harmony among all our people.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. Kemp?</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: Jim, my position on affirmative action has been
    clear ever since I left the professional football career for
    Congress in 1970.</p>
    <p>Some people think I quit playing a few years earlier, but I
    retired in 1970. My life has been dedicated to equality of
    opportunity and our democracy should provide that, not equality
    of reward.</p>
    <p>Affirmative action should be predicated upon need, not
    equality of reward, not equality of outcome. Quotas have always
    been against the American ideal. We should promote diversity
    and do it the way Bob Dole has been talking about, with a new
    civil rights agenda, based upon expanding access to credit and
    capital, job opportunities, educational choice in our inner
    cities for a young urban mother who can't get the type of an
    education she wants for her child and ultimately the type of
    ownership and entrepreneurship from public housing residents in
    D.C. to Nickerson Gardens in Watts, Los Angeles. People need to
    own. That's what Abraham Lincoln believed, when people own
    something, they have the stake in the American dream. That is
    affirmative action in America.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. Vice President?</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: With all due respect, I do not believe
    that Abraham Lincoln would have adopted Bob Dole's position to
    end all affirmative action.</p>
    <p>There is a specific measure on the ballot in California. It
    was embodied in legislation introduced by Senator Dole to apply
    to the whole nation. Mr. Kemp campaigned against it, spoke
    against it, wrote letters against it, went to California to
    fight against it, and now has endorsed it.</p>
    <p>I don't think it is a minor matter. I think this is one of
    the most important challenges that our country has to face in
    the future.</p>
    <p>And I hope that Mr. Kemp will try to persuade Senator Dole
    to adopt Mr. Kemp's position, instead of the other way
    around.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. Kemp, what is your position --</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: Does the light mean we are supposed to stop?</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Right.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: You thought that was going to be your
    problem, not mine?</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: I can't believe I am keeping within the time
    limit.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. Kemp, do we have a serious race problem in
    the United States right now?</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: Yes, we really do. This country has yet to deal
    with the type of inclusionary policies. It is so very important
    for Americans, white and black, Jew and Christian, immigrant
    and native born to sit down and talk and listen and begin to
    understand what it's like to come from that different
    perspective.</p>
    <p>Our country, as the Kerner Commission report suggested a
    number of years ago, was being split between white and black. I
    think it is being split, not so much between white and black,
    although that is a serious problem. We really have two
    economies.</p>
    <p>Our general economy, our national economy, our mainstream
    economy is democratic, is based on incentives, a small �d�, Al.
    It's capitalism and incentives for working and saving and
    investing and producing and families and the things that really
    lead to progress up that ladder that we call the American
    dream, but what is really universal.</p>
    <p>But unfortunately in urban America -- and I was glad to hear
    the Vice President talk a little bit about it --they have
    abandoned the inner cities. There is a socialistic economy.
    There is no private housing. It is mostly public housing. You
    are told where to go to school. You are told what to buy with
    food stamps. It is a welfare system that is more like a Third
    World socialist country than what we would expect from the
    world's greatest democratic free enterprise system. That must
    change and it will under Bob Dole and Jack Kemp.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: Remember what I said just a moment ago.
    If it were not so, he would have told you. The problems between
    races in America must be addressed. The good news is we are
    making progress. We have seen ten-and-a-half million new jobs
    created in the last four years.</p>
    <p>We have seen the unemployment rate come down dramatically.
    We have seen the African-American unemployment rate go below
    double digits for the first time in 25 years and it stayed
    below for 25 months in a row.</p>
    <p>We have empowerment zones and enterprise communities -- 105
    of them in communities all across the United States of America.
    Let me tell you a story about Joanne Crowder in Detroit. She
    was on welfare for eight years, until the empowerment zone was
    created there. She just got a job in the new business that
    launched its enterprise right in that empowerment zone. We want
    to do that for millions more all across the country.</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: With all due respect, Jim, there are nine
    empowerment zones, a few little tinkerings with tax credits
    around the country for inner cities. Los Angeles, after the
    riots did not even get an empowerment zone, believe it or not.
    That is just unconscionable in America to have left Watts,
    South Central and East L.A. out. Earl Graves of Black
    Enterprise Magazine said the single greatest deterrent to lack
    of advancement is the lack of access to capital, credit and
    ownership. That will change. We will green line every city in
    the United States where there is unemployment and welfare. And
    we will eliminate the capital gains tax and eliminate the tax
    on a welfare mother that takes a job. That's the answer if
    ownership and entrepreneurship, to low-income people based on
    need, not the color of their skin.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. Vice President, if reelected, what could we
    look forward to in the way of an inner-city policy from a
    Clinton-Gore second term?</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: Before I answer that specific question,
    let me say that we did put an empowerment zone in South Central
    Los Angeles. It is in the form of the largest community
    development financial institution ever created in the United
    States or in any other country.</p>
    <p>And it is creating jobs in South Central Los Angeles right
    now. The Congress passed an enterprise zone after the Los
    Angeles riots five years ago.</p>
    <p>It was vetoed by the prior administration. Now, to your
    question: We have a specific plan to create 1 million new jobs
    in the inner cities of America with tax credits for employers
    who hire people coming off welfare, because we have passed
    welfare reform now. We promised to end welfare as we know it,
    and we are implementing this new legislation.</p>
    <p>We have moved 1.9 million people off of the welfare rolls
    and into good jobs in the last four years. Our new plan is to
    have 1 million more jobs in the inner cities.</p>
    <p>But that's not all. We are also implementing the plan to put
    100,000 community police officers in our cities. We have
    already got 20,000 out there. We are ahead of our six-year
    schedule. As a matter of fact, there are eight here in St.
    Petersburg already on the beat. You may run into one of them
    leaving this auditorium tonight. St. Petersburg is safer
    because of this urban agenda that we�re following.</p>
    <p>We want the focus to be on millions more jobs and we are
    very optimistic that it's going to happen.</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: Well, we have had four years and there is no
    enterprise zone. There are empowerment zones, but you have to
    do what Bill Clinton and Al Gore want you to do. You get a
    $5,000 tax credit if you hire somebody that's unemployed, but
    you already have to have an existing business.</p>
    <p>The answer is to say, once again, green line any area in
    America that has been red lined for lack of mortgage money,
    lack of credit and capital. Just say that area qualifies for no
    capital gains tax, zero, nada. That's what Eleanor
    Holmes-Norton wants to do in the District of Columbia and this
    administration said to D.C., �drop dead�. Drop dead.</p>
    <p>We don't want to change the legislation that would lower the
    tax rate in D.C., allow welfare mothers to take a job without
    any tax on the first 190 percent of her income and no capital
    gains tax. That should be done in every urban area of America.
    That would make capital flow back and you can't have
    capitalism, Al, without capital.</p>
    <p>You may want to, to give a tax credit but it won't work.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: Well, we have 105 empowerment zones and
    enterprise communities all across the United States of America.
    And with all due respect, that's 105 more than were there when
    we came into the White House.</p>
    <p>We have been implementing them in a determined way. They are
    making the difference. You know, that empowerment zone that I
    mentioned in Detroit is creating jobs not only for Joanne
    Crowder, who feels proud that she is off of welfare now and we
    are proud of her. It is creating jobs for hundreds of others
    and similar initiatives are working in the other empowerment
    zones.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. Kemp, you said recently one of the problems
    related to this was that all the capital was in the hands of
    the white people. What did you mean by that?</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: The single greatest problem in our opinion,
    domestic, in the domestic economy, is that this tax code, 83
    years old, a relic of the Cold War and hot war, inflation and
    depression, seven-and-a-half million words long, overtaxes
    capital, overtaxes working men and women and families, clearly
    the Gordian knot needs to be broken in one fell swoop.</p>
    <p>Jack Kemp and Bob Dole, as soon as we get into the first
    step of cutting the tax rates across the board are going to
    repeal the whole code. While Bill Clinton and my friend Al
    Gore, defend the status quo, we are going to repeal the
    seven-and-a-half million words of the U.S. tax code and make it
    once and for all tax income once, not twice, three, four and if
    you die, it confiscates your estate. That's unacceptable. We
    must have a tax code going into the 21st Century that does not
    protect the establishment and this tax code does.</p>
    <p>And by cutting and eliminating the capital gains, by cutting
    and eliminating the estate tax, and bringing the top tax rate
    down to something reasonable, like, here he goes again, I think
    in peace time it shouldn't be higher, Bob and I don't think it
    should be higher than 20 percent, be phased in, capital would
    flow out into the economy, we would have people giving access
    to capital, small businessmen and women, African American,
    Asian Americans, Latino Americans, female Americans would be
    able to start the businesses.</p>
    <p>Dana Crist of Lancaster said the day the tax bill is passed
    in Congress she will open a new factory with 40 or 50 employees
    in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He will call it trickle down. I
    call it Niagara Falls.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: The problem with this version of
    Niagara Falls is that Senator Dole and Mr. Kemp would put the
    American economy in a barrel and send it over the falls.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: It is a risky $550 billion tax scheme
    that actually raises taxes on nine million of the hardest
    working families. Again, Mr. Kemp opposed that and called it
    unconscionable. Now it is part of the plan that he is
    supporting. Not only that, though, it would blow a hole in the
    deficit. It would raise interest rates. That means higher
    mortgage payments, particularly those with the variable rate
    mortgages, higher car payments, it would also lead to much
    deeper cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the
    environment.</p>
    <p>It is extremely risky. And as for these harsh words, I don't
    take them personally. He said much worse about Bob Dole when he
    said Bob Dole never met a tax that he didn't hike. He wrote
    about 450 separate provisions in that code. You better check
    with him before you eliminate it completely. He may be getting
    royalties.</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: Jim, a $550 billion tax cut, this is something Al
    does not want to mention, has to be viewed against the context
    of a $50 trillion U.S. economy output of goods and services
    over the next six years.</p>
    <p>A $550 billion tax cut in a $50 trillion economy over six
    years is one and a half percent, and the only hole it would
    blow is a hole in the plans of this administration to try to
    tinker with the tax code and defend the indefensible. It would
    blow up the bureaucracy, but it would expand the economy.
    That's important for America.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. Vice President, what about Mr. Kemp's point
    he made a couple of times, what we need is to throw away the
    current, the present tax code and write a whole new tax
    system.</p>
    <p>Do you agree with that?</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: We have passed the taxpayer bill of
    rights. We have fought for new provisions that now make it
    possible to file over the telephone. We are fightingxes on
    middle-income families with several specific provisions.</p>
    <p>We already cut taxes on 15 million working families in this
    country with an average of about a thousand dollars in tax
    relief to those making $25,000 a year or less, and for the last
    two years, we have had middle income tax cuts on the table in
    the Congress and they would not -- they weren't accepted by Bob
    Dole and Newt Gingrich because they said they would not pass
    them without cutting deeply into Medicare, Medicaid, education
    and the environment.</p>
    <p>We are determined to move forward. During these next four
    years, with the tax cuts President Bill Clinton has proposed.
    Here they are again, a $1500 tax credit for tuition, a $10,000
    tax deduction so that no family pays taxes on the money for
    college tuition. Capital gains eliminated for the sale of a
    home, a tax break for first-time home buyers and health care
    expenses and a $500 child tax credit.</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: You only give a tax cut in the Clinton
    Administration if you do exactly what Al Gore and Bill Clinton
    want you to do. It is not America. When John F. Kennedy cut tax
    rates, the economy grew, unemployment went down and we balanced
    the budget and revenues went up. Indeed, the secretary Treasury
    under John F. Kennedy and Deputy Secretary Treasury under John
    F. Kennedy endorsed Bob Dole's plan to cut rates, cut the
    capital gains tax, balance the budget, provide a $500 tax
    credit and clearly a plan should be to lift the economy, to get
    more revenue.</p>
    <p>Medicare will be saved because it will be put into a
    Commission where both Bill Clinton and Bob Dole recognize, it
    has to be studied by the same people that would study our did
    study, I should say, the Social Security system and saved it in
    1983 and '84.</p>
    <p>Look, we can bring down government, the growth of government
    spending, but we have to grow the economy and in Bob Dole and
    Jack Kemp's opinion, we should aim at doubling the size of the
    American economy in the next 15 years. Under their policies, it
    will take 30 to 40 years and that's not acceptable.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: The chairman of their national campaign
    Steering Committee, Senator D'Amato said Bob Dole would have to
    cut into Medicare in order to pay for this proposal, but that
    he would wait until after the election to do it.</p>
    <p>The proposal to cut Medicare that Senator Dole pushed before
    and shut down the government to try to enact would have already
    raised, by $268, the fees paid by the average couple now on
    Medicare.</p>
    <p>He tried to double the deductibles and give people less in
    return. We have a balanced budget plan that protects Medicare
    and gives tax cuts.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. Kemp, is it really possible to balance the
    budget without reforming drastically the entitlements programs,
    including Social Security and Medicare?</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: Before I answer that, Jim, let me just say it is
    disgraceful, the campaign being waged to scare the American
    senior citizens in this state and my home state of -- well, New
    York and California.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: One other one in there, isn't
    there?</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: Yes, Maryland now, about Medicare. The amount of
    money being spent to try to mislead the American people is
    demagoguery also only in the Clinton White House and Al Gore's
    mind could an increase in spending per capita on a senior
    citizen from $4800 in 1996 to $7200 over the next five years,
    be considered a cut.</p>
    <p>Does anybody think Bob Dole, who almost gave his life for
    his country, who has served in the Senate, who helped save
    Social Security, crawled out of a foxhole on Riva�s Ridge in
    Northern Italy in 1945 to save a wounded radio man, does anyone
    think in this country he could possibly want to move our
    country ahead and leave anybody behind? Of course, we can
    balance the budget. Of course, we have to hold down the growth
    and entitlement spending.</p>
    <p>But clearly, you cannot balance the budget, Jim, without
    growing this economy. It is only growing at about 2.5 percent.
    We should double the rate of growth and we should double the
    size of the American economy. This means more jobs, more
    wealth, more income and more capital, particularly for our
    nation's poor and those left behind.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: Mr. Lehrer, our balanced budget plan
    extends the trust fund ten years into the future. A Commission
    is fine. But a Commission would not do any good if we adopted
    this risky $550 billion tax scheme.</p>
    <p>The word scary has been used. A couple of days ago I went
    with governor Lawton Chiles who was here to Sarasota, the
    Friendship Senior Center. I talked with a woman named Dorothy
    Warnell and she said: You know, we may not be as sophisticated
    as some of those people in Washington, but we can add and
    subtract. Here are the numbers she is adding and
    subtracting.</p>
    <p>Bob Dole's plan would have already imposed an extra $268 on
    the average Medicare receiving couple, and his plan would have
    doubled deductibles. It would have cost an extra $1700 over the
    lifetime of his plan and eliminated nursing home standards and
    guarantees of nursing home care for seniors.</p>
    <p>Bill Clinton prevented it from happening. We will never
    allow that to happen.</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: Jim, Medicare is too important to senior citizens
    around this country to play the type of politics that is being
    played on this issue.</p>
    <p>It is losing $8 billion as we stand here tonight. By the
    President's own trustees of Medicare, three members of which
    serve in his Cabinet, it will be losing $23 billion a year by
    1998, something must be done, Bob Dole has suggested a
    Commission, but clearly, you cannot save Medicare, Social
    Security or any program for the social welfare net of American
    people under which they should not be allowed to fall, unless
    we grow this economy at least twice the rate it is growing
    today. That is the issue, not scaring people in America.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. Vice President, Mr. Kemp has accused you of
    demagoguery.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: As I said before, he used much harsher
    language when he talked about Bob Dole. He said that Bob Dole's
    solution for every single problem was to increase taxes. He
    said just two years ago that the Bob Dole tax increase of 1982
    was the largest tax increase in the history of the world.</p>
    <p>But let's get to the point. Medicare has been adjusted 23
    times since it was created in 1965. Bob Dole, incidentally,
    just bragged this year that he was one of only 12 people who
    voted against the creation of Medicare in the first place.</p>
    <p>I don't think -- he didn't believe in it then and the plan
    that he promoted last year would have certainly been
    devastating to Medicare. Again, don't take my word for it. The
    American Hospital Association said it could have closed 700
    hospitals. The Catholic Health Association, the AARP, and many
    other groups who pay careful attention to Medicare said that
    the Dole-Gingrich plan on Medicare would have led to deep cuts,
    possibly set up a two-tiered system and would have ended the
    kind of Medicare system that we have.</p>
    <p>Our plan extends Medicare ten years into the future. We will
    always protect Medicare within the context of a balanced budget
    plan.</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: Folks, they have no plan. They have absolutely no
    plan. The President himself suggested that the reduction in the
    growth of Medicare over the next five or six years ought to be
    held to 6 percent under the Republican plan. Irrespective of
    the numbers, it will grow at 7 or even more percent.</p>
    <p>But that is beside the point. What has to be discussed is
    how we as a nation are going to create the size of an economy,
    create a national wealth that would at least double this $6- or
    $7 trillion dollar economy. We would have $6 trillion in 15
    years extra wealth for the American people, another trillion
    dollars of revenue, with which to save Medicare, and Social
    Security, and you can't do it with a tax code and a regulatory
    code and people suing each other with frivolous suits, as this
    administration is allowing to happen.</p>
    <p>That has to change and it will under Bob Dole and Jack
    Kemp.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: I think Mr. Kemp has unintentionally
    made a mistake in saying that President Clinton called for
    reduction to 6 percent or whatever you said. I believe you are
    referring to the Money Magazine interview and the publisher of
    Money Magazine just sent a letter to Mr. Kemp two days ago,
    asking him to please stop inaccurately citing Money Magazine.
    It is not what the President said. It is not the President's
    position.</p>
    <p>Let me make clear what his position is. We will save
    Medicare. We will stop efforts to hurt Medicare and will do it
    within a balanced budget plan.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. Kemp, what if anything would a Dole-Kemp
    administration do to change the current legal status of
    abortion in this country?</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: I will answer the question, but for the record, I
    would like to release the letter to our friends in the press of
    the letter I got from Money Magazine, suggesting that Bill
    Clinton wanted and did lower the cost-of-living allowance for
    senior citizens as a way of reducing Social Security.</p>
    <p>Putting that aside, we recognize there is no consensus in
    America. This country is split between those who call
    themselves pro-choice and I am sure very sincerely and those of
    us who call ourselves pro-life. This is a very emotional issue.
    I am sure it is for a woman; it certainly is for those of us
    like my wife and myself who have three adopted
    grandchildren.</p>
    <p>We thank God every night of our lives that a young woman was
    given a choice, was given the opportunity to choose life. This
    country should not be torn asunder over this debate. It has to
    be carried out with civility and respect and we believe it can
    be, but we should recognize every human life is precious and
    there should be all the protection you can give for an unborn
    human being.</p>
    <p>And to think in this country for every three births, there
    is one abortion, but even worse than that, as ugly as that
    might be and I know it is a tragedy for many people both on the
    pro-choice and pro-life position, we have a President who
    vetoed a congressional ban on the ugly and gruesome practice of
    snatching life away from a child just moments before he or she
    enters the world. That is unacceptable.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Vice President.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: President Clinton has made it clear he
    will sign legislation outlawing procedures such as these, if
    there is an exception to protect the health of the mother where
    serious health consequences, such as the inability to have any
    further children are involved, and her doctor advises her
    so.</p>
    <p>What is really at stake here is whether or not women will
    have the right to choose. The platform on which Mr. Kemp and
    Senator Dole are running pledges a constitutional amendment to
    take away a woman's right to choose and to have the government
    come in and order that woman to do what the government says no
    matter what the circumstances.</p>
    <p>Mr. Kemp has voted 47 out of 47 times to have such an
    amendment and to restrict this completely, no matter what the
    circumstances, even where rape and incest is involved.</p>
    <p>We will never allow a woman's choice to choose to be taken
    away.</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: There is no consensus. A constitutional amendment
    would not pass. We must use persuasion, not intimidation. Bob
    Dole and Jack Kemp will try to remind the American people of
    what a tremendous asset our children are and why there should
    be protection for innocent human life, including that of the
    unborn.</p>
    <p>But to think of this administration vetoed the one chance
    they had to ban that practice without working with people in
    the Congress who would have loved to have had the opportunity
    to stop that gruesome practice is just unacceptable to the
    American people and Bob Dole would never have vetoed that ban
    on partial birth abortion in the third trimester of a woman's
    pregnancy.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. Vice President, is the war in Bosnia really
    over or is it going to break out again once the U.S. and the
    NATO troops leave?</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: The fighting has stopped in Bosnia.
    President Bill Clinton showed tremendous courage, vision,
    wisdom and leadership in having our country take the lead in
    rallying our allies, bringing the warring together in Dayton,
    Ohio and hammering out a peace agreement that has ended the war
    in Bosnia. We hope that it will stay over with. Elections have
    just been held.</p>
    <p>There is great progress toward peace and reconciliation in
    Bosnia. We ought to be very proud of our soldiers who have
    played such a critical role in bringing about this peace in
    Bosnia.</p>
    <p>It is not the only case where Bill Clinton has provided such
    leadership. We have restored Democracy to Haiti with scarcely a
    shot being fired. We have seen movement toward reconciliation
    in Northern Ireland and in the Middle East. The Bible says
    there will always be wars and rumors of wars.</p>
    <p>As the President said the other night, there will always be
    troubles in this old world, but the United States of America
    can be counted on to provide the vision that the world looks
    for from the United States of America.</p>
    <p>Bill Clinton, as President, has provided that kind of
    leadership. We are more secure and stronger today because of
    Bill Clinton's handling of foreign policy.</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: Bob Dole supported the deployment of troops in
    Bosnia, but the problem with the foreign policy of this
    administration, there is none. It is ambiguous. It is
    contradictory. It is precipitous to go into Iraq with bombing
    before we had even consulted with our allies, to think that Sam
    Nunn of Georgia or Colin Powell, who help put together the
    coalition in the Persian Gulf were not even consulted. It was
    not only precipitous. It was a sign not of strength, but of
    weakness.</p>
    <p>What is worse, they declared victory in every deployment. We
    have had more deployments in four years than any previous four
    years I can think of. I am 61 years of age. It is unbelievable
    that ambiguity can be called a foreign policy.</p>
    <p>Let me say what a friend of mine told me and I believe it
    from my whole career. Weakness is provocative. And our message
    should be clear and that's what our message would be to the
    world under Bob Dole as Commander in Chief of the United States
    of America.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: We did, of course, consult with our
    allies before we bombed Saddam Hussein. But sometimes the
    United States has to take unilateral action, when our interests
    are at stake.</p>
    <p>General Schwarzkopf is in the audience tonight. We are
    awfully proud of the way he led our coalition organized under
    former President Bush. When the United States led toward the
    repulsing of Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. Three times, as he has
    tried to get out of that box, Saddam Hussein has felt the sting
    of a swift, certain response from the United States of America
    under President Bill Clinton.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. Kemp, Senator Dole has criticized the
    President on Haiti, said he handled that wrong. What did he do
    wrong?</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: Well, it was Bob Dole that suggested that there be
    a fact-finding commission. President Carter was on it. Colin
    Powell was on it. You cannot say in our opinion that Haiti is a
    great success. Clearly, it was maybe the right thing to do, but
    we did not go in with enough information. We caused problems in
    the first place by denying Caribbean countries and Third-World
    countries a chance to trade freely in the United States. It
    causes economic problems and turmoil and then we turn around,
    as we did in Mexico, having to bail them out.</p>
    <p>We caused the problem in the first place and it cost us $20
    to $50 billion to bail them out.</p>
    <p>Haiti is very ambiguous at best. We pray that democracy
    comes to Haiti, but so far the message from Haiti is quite
    ambiguous, notwithstanding the declaration of victory by this
    administration.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: Well, I didn't hear anything wrong. The
    fact is we restored democracy to Haiti, when I say restored,
    actually it was the first real democracy Haiti has ever had.
    And it happened with scarcely any shots being fired.</p>
    <p>I was in the Oval Office the night when President Clinton
    dispatched our troops from Fort Bragg. It was a tense moment.
    The planes were in the air and our negotiators were talking
    with the dictator down there, and when that dictator got the
    news from his spies outside the gate that all these planes were
    taking off, he said: �Let's get out of here.�</p>
    <p>That's how it was done. It was one of the most deft uses of
    diplomacy and military force in combination that you will find
    anywhere in the annals of the history of this country.</p>
    <p>I was so proud of our President in the way he handled that,
    and the result so far is excellent. And we hope and pray that
    it will remain that way.</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: Many more results like Bosnia, Haiti, Mexico and
    the Middle East, we won't have much success. One of the most
    serious, one of the most serious problems was the tremendous
    effort by this administration to force on Mexico a devaluation
    of their peso. The economy dropped by 40 to 50 percent. Then we
    go in and bail them out, we cause the problem, and then we have
    to bail them out.</p>
    <p>We should have a foreign policy as predicated upon trade,
    spreading democracy, giving people opportunities to trade
    freely with us and making sure that everybody recognizes the
    role of the, the Golden Rule, do unto others as you would have
    them do unto you. Diplomacy first and don't bomb before
    breakfast.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. Vice President, Mexico, we caused a problem
    and then had to go in and bail them out?</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: No, that's not right. When Mr. Kemp
    started talking about the Golden Rule, I thought he was going
    to talk about the Gold Standard again. That used to be an
    integral part of this supply side economics, but it may be
    something else that he now agrees with Bob Dole on because Bob
    Dole voted to take us off the Gold Standard -- a wise vote in
    my opinion -- most all economists say that if we did that, it
    would throw us into a deep recession or depression and throw
    millions out of work.</p>
    <p>Let me come directly to this question. No, when there was a
    crisis involving the Mexican peso again, President Bill Clinton
    showed bold and dynamic leadership. I want to hasten to add
    Senator Bob Dole gave critical bipartisan support at the
    time.</p>
    <p>He agreed with the President. He supported the President. He
    said this is a wise move. He could not get a majority in the
    Senate and Speaker Gingrich could not get a majority in the
    House to go on record in support of it, so the President, as
    presidents often have to do, went alone and did the right
    thing.</p>
    <p>You know, people said it was a big risk at that time. We
    ended up making a $500 million profit. All of the loans have
    been paid back. We are using that $500 million to further
    reduce the deficit.</p>
    <p>It has come down 60 percent already. It is going down even
    more toward a balanced budget and this is helping.</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: It is unbelievable that we could cause a drop in
    the standard of living of a friendly country like Mexico by
    nearly 40 to 50 percent unemployment goes up. We send U.S. tax
    dollars and IMF monies to Mexico, and we make a profit.</p>
    <p>At that level, that gives new meaning to the word
    profitability for U.S. foreign policy.</p>
    <p>The pain, the suffering, the unemployment, the bankruptcies,
    the loss of the standard of living, the people have had to come
    across the border of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas,
    if that's our foreign policy for the Third World or Latin
    America, I believe more than ever we have got to elect a
    President who understands trade, who understands honest money,
    who understands private enterprise, who understands democratic
    capitalism, not socialism caused by the IMF and the Clinton
    Administration.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: Well, I fail to understand the basis of
    the charge that we caused the monetary prices in Mexico.</p>
    <p>They managed their own monetary policy. Years ago we used to
    hear this phrase in American politics, �the blame America first
    crowd�. I never liked that phrase. But if it was going to be
    applied today, it would have to be applied to this
    statement.</p>
    <p>The United States of America shouldn't be blamed for the
    management of Mexico's monetary policy. We helped our neighbor
    in an hour of need, and they survived, they are stronger, they
    are coming back, they paid us back, and we got a dividend in
    the process.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. Kemp, Senator Dole the other night
    criticized President Clinton for cutting defense spending and
    thus cutting jobs in California. Is that how defense spending
    should be seen, as a jobs program as well?</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: I don't think, Jim, that Bob Dole was suggesting
    the defense of our country is a job or socioeconomic program,
    but it is clear that the defense budget of this administration
    has taken defense as a percent of our national economy to a
    lower level than it was prior to Pearl Harbor. That's
    dangerous. And that's provocative.</p>
    <p>And a mixed message, the ambiguities of U.S. foreign policy
    are, I believe, and Bob Dole believes, is causing not only
    problems for this country throughout the world, but
    particularly here at home and the type of changes that were
    made overnight in California caused very severe
    dislocations.</p>
    <p>And then, of course, the President ran out to California and
    announced, well, maybe we will have another B-1 or B-2 bomber.
    That is not the way policies should be made. It should be
    predicated upon the defense needs, the security needs, the
    strategic needs of the United States of America and that's how
    they will be made under Bob Dole as President.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: First of all, there are virtually no
    large differences in the defense budgets put forward by
    President Clinton and put forward by the majority in the
    Congress in the last two years. They are very, very similar.
    There is a huge difference in our economic plan.</p>
    <p>This risky, $550 billion tax scheme that I talked about
    earlier is said by the Concord Coalition, including Republicans
    like Pete Peterson and Warren Rudman to pose a threat to our
    nation's ability to have a sensible defense budget in the
    future.</p>
    <p>They have gone on record as saying that this tax scheme
    would not only raise taxes on 9 million hardworking American
    families, but would also lead almost inevitably to deep cuts in
    Medicare and in defense.</p>
    <p>We have a balanced budget plan that protects the defense
    budget, also Medicare, Medicaid, education, the environment and
    gives tax cuts to middle-income families.</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: Jim, Al has to hear one more time, every time in
    this century we have lowered the tax rates across the board on
    employment, saving, investment and risk taking in this economy,
    revenues went up, not down.</p>
    <p>The purpose of the tax code is to raise revenue, we ought to
    think, as John F. Kennedy did about lowering the rates. They
    can't go to zero. They can't go too low because there is not
    enough revenue, but President Clinton apologized in Houston for
    saying, oops, I raised your taxes and they are too high.
    President Bush apologized for raising taxes. Bob Dole knows
    that the rates have to come down across the board and then we
    will get to the most important part, to repeal this code and go
    to a new system for the 21st Century.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. Vice President, some Democrats have charged
    that the environment would be in jeopardy if Mr. Kemp and
    Senator Dole are elected. Do you share that fear?</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: I certainly do. Let me first say that
    in citing John F. Kennedy's tax cut in the 1960s, I want to
    also remind you that Mr. Kemp has pointed out in the past, Bob
    Dole was in the Congress then. He was one of those who voted
    against John F. Kennedy's tax cut.</p>
    <p>The environment faces dire threats from the kind of
    legislation that Senator Dole and speaker Newt Gingrich tried
    to pass by shutting down the government and attempting to force
    President Clinton to accept it.</p>
    <p>They invited the lobbyists for the biggest polluters of
    America to come into the Congress and literally rewrite the
    Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act. President Clinton stopped
    them dead in their tracks.</p>
    <p>We have a positive agenda on the environment because we
    believe very deeply that it is about our children and our
    future, clean air and clean water, cleaning up toxic waste
    sites when millions of children live within one mile of them.
    That's important. We have a plan to clean up two-thirds of the
    toxic waste sites in America over the next four years.</p>
    <p>We have already cleaned up more in the last three years than
    the previous two administrations did in 12. The President just
    set aside the Utah national monument, he is protecting the
    Everglades here in Florida.</p>
    <p>Bob Dole is opposed to that plan. President Bill Clinton
    will protect our environment and prevent the kind of a tax on
    it that we saw in the last Congress and that are included in
    the Republican platform.</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: And so will Bob Dole. Al, get real. Franklin
    Roosevelt said in 1932 that the only thing we have to fear is
    fear itself. The only thing, Jim, they have to offer is fear,
    fear of the environment, fear of the climate, fear of Medicare,
    fear of Newt, fear of Republicans, fear of Bob and probably
    fear of cutting tax rates. They ain't seen nothing yet.</p>
    <p>Look, we recognize this country has to live in balance with
    our environment. Everyone of us who have children and
    grandchildren recognize how we have to reach a balance.</p>
    <p>It is not jobs versus our environment. Both are important.
    This is the most overregulated, overly litigated economy in our
    nation's history. And to call a businessman or woman who sits
    down and has a chance to express his or her interest in how to
    make these laws work and call them a polluter is outrageous. It
    is typical of the anti-capitalistic mentality of this
    administration. That will change because we believe in
    democratic capitalism for everybody.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: There are lots of jobs to be created in
    cleaning up the environment. All around the world we are seeing
    problems that people want to solve because they love their
    children, they want them to be able to drink clean water, and
    breathe clean air. They don't want them to live next to toxic
    waste sites.</p>
    <p>When the United States of America takes the lead in
    protecting the environment, we do right by our children and we
    also create new business opportunities, new jobs, new sources
    of prosperity for the United States of America. And we are
    going about it in a common sense way.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. Kemp, you mentioned already before, you said
    on Meet the Press Sunday that the Federal Government engages in
    "regulation reign of terror." What exactly do you mean?</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: Exactly just what I said. Regulations that would
    take property or reduce the value, some farmer or rancher or
    homeowner's property or wetlands or endangered species and take
    that property or reduce its value without compensating the
    owner. That is a reign of terror.</p>
    <p>It is happening. In Oregon not too long ago a farmer took 25
    percent of his property and declared it a wetland. It had the
    run-off of snow that allowed it to be declared a wetland, but
    he did it himself voluntarily. He found within a couple of
    years that the bald eagle began to use it as a habitat. The
    Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Wildlife and Fisheries, all
    of the federal agencies came on to his property, declared it a
    federal wetland and said he couldn't drive, they took away the
    road, they couldn't mend his fences and they wouldn't pay the
    value of the loss of the -- they wouldn't pay or compensate, I
    should say, for the loss of value to that property.</p>
    <p>How can we as a free society turn people into enemies or
    adversaries of the United States Government?</p>
    <p>OSHA does it, EPA does it, ERDA does it and you name it, we
    should recognize this country should live in such a way as to
    build an alliance with our free enterprise system that can
    build a better America for our children and grandchildren.</p>
    <p>We can do it, but it has to take new leadership in
    Washington.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: Well, it takes values that recognize
    the importance of the environment. Mr. Kemp voted against the
    Clean Water Act, voted against the renewal of the Superfund
    Act. We have been taking a new approach, protecting the
    environment, but getting rid of unnecessary regulations.</p>
    <p>We are eliminating 16,000 pages of regulations. We have
    entered into a new project called project XL. This is at the
    EPA. Where we enter into a bargain with businesses. When they
    say we will exceed the standards, we say give us, give the EPA
    a way to measure the progress and throw away the rule book all
    together.</p>
    <p>Now, this is the kind of common sense approach that can
    clean up the environment while eliminating unnecessary red
    tape. Make no mistake about it, though. There are those who
    would like to go much further.</p>
    <p>Some have even proposed, and this bill he cites would do it,
    that polluters ought to be paid if they agree to stop dumping
    poisons into the river. The paid polluters provision is wrong.
    We fought against it, we will never allow that.</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: When I went to Congress from Buffalo in 1970, you
    could almost walk across Lake Erie because of the pollution.
    Today, thanks to the secondary and tertiary treatment plants,
    which many of us voted for on both sides of the aisle, which
    actually started under Richard Nixon, a Republican President,
    our water is cleaner in the Great Lakes. We have a lot of
    progress that we have made and we have to make more.</p>
    <p>But to turn the country into a regulatory effort by the
    Federal Government, to suggest we can't work in harmony, A,
    with the environment and with business, is a big mistake.</p>
    <p>We should use incentives, not always using sticks against
    business in America and the jobs that it creates.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. Vice President, does the government of the
    United States, as now operated by the Clinton Administration,
    operate on a reign of terror, through a reign of terror?</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: No, of course not. We are taking a
    brand new approach to eliminate unnecessary regulations,
    unnecessary bureaucracy. We have lots of examples of this.
    There was a story in the newspaper the other day about a home
    testing kit that the FDA had held up. That happened under a
    rule in the last administration.</p>
    <p>We said change that rule. It is being changed now. It is
    under consideration by the FDA right now and it will be
    changed. There are thousands of other examples.</p>
    <p>We believe that there is a new approach. Let me give you an
    example from OSHA. We are reinventing the way OSHA does its
    job. Some people would like to eliminate OSHA. We think the
    protection of job safety in the workplace is very, very
    important.</p>
    <p>But what we have said is: Look, start measuring the results.
    We found that the inspectors were being rewarded on the basis
    of how many fines they issued. We changed that completely. They
    used to go in and give somebody a fine if they didn't have a
    poster on the wall informing employees of their rights.</p>
    <p>To use this as an example of our new approach, now, if they
    go in and see that poster is not there, they go out to the
    trunk of the car and give them a poster. It is the same
    approach we are taking in the regulatory agencies. We are
    making a lot of progress. We want the protection with common
    sense, not nonsense.</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: We have to have the type of economic prosperity
    that will allow us to generate the revenues to provide this
    technology. 10 percent of all the emissions -- 10 percent of
    all the hydrocarbon emissions, oxides going into the air are
    caused by 10 percent -- 100 percent of all the emissions are
    caused by 10 percent of the automobiles.</p>
    <p>Now, there is technology that would allow infrared
    technology to be used to identify those cars that are providing
    pollution in our atmosphere, et cetera not being able to be
    used because we are going to take every automobile driver in
    America, all 110 million automobiles and charge them $17 or $20
    or $25.</p>
    <p>Look, we ought to go after the ones that pollute, not go
    after the men and women who want to be able to drive their
    automobile to work or school and make sure that they have the
    type of opportunity to live like everyone else, without having
    themselves regulated by a Washington establishment.</p>
    <p>We can use technology. That's the answer, but to get the
    technology, you have to have a growing economy. This economy is
    not growing fast enough and it will under Bob Dole and Jack
    Kemp.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: Well, the economy is growing very
    strongly right now. We have had ten-and-a-half million new jobs
    created just in the last four years. The last quarter growth
    rate was 4.7 percent. The average growth rate is coming up. It
    is higher than in either of the last two Republican
    administrations.</p>
    <p>Bob Dole said in February of this year, this is the
    strongest economy in 30 years. The conservative business
    journal, Barrons, says this is the strongest economy in 30
    years.</p>
    <p>We have got good, solid growth. Let's don't risk it on some
    $550 billion risky scheme.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: What measurement do you use, Mr. Kemp, in saying
    the economy is not growing the way it should be?</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: Well, as I said earlier, Jim, it takes two bread
    winners to do what one bread winner could have done a
    relatively short few years ago. As long as a man or woman wants
    to go to work, it ought to be their choice.</p>
    <p>In America today that woman or man must work in a family to,
    one, to pay the tax and the other to help the family. That's
    not America.</p>
    <p>It doesn't leave enough time for the children. It doesn't
    leave enough time for people to enjoy their families. It
    doesn't allow people to say, the family is the most overtaxed
    institution in the United States of America.</p>
    <p>When I was growing up in Los Angeles, a family, median level
    of income might have sent 4 or 5 percent of their income to the
    Federal Government. Today it is close to 30 or at least 27 or
    28 percent. That's just unacceptable and for Al Gore to keep
    suggesting we can't afford to reduce the tax rate across the
    board on the American people and on the formation of the
    capital necessary to create the new jobs for America is just
    totally at odds with the experience of both Ronald Reagan, John
    F. Kennedy and other times in this century.</p>
    <p>One other thing that's very, very important. To call it a
    risky scheme reminds me of the fact that this administration is
    suggesting that they are going to give you a tax cut if you do
    what they want you to do.</p>
    <p>They want to cut the capital gains tax but only for
    homeowners. How about the small businessmen and women of
    America? They create 91 percent of all the new jobs.</p>
    <p>My dad was a truck driver who bought a truck and started a
    company. We need more truck drivers becoming truck owners and
    they can't do it if they don't have access to the capital and
    the seed corn for the next generation for America.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: We have the creation of more new small
    businesses in the last four years, in each of the last years,
    than this any other year in all American history. We have seen
    the creation of ten-and-a-half million new jobs. We have the
    lowest combined rate of inflation and unemployment in 30
    years.</p>
    <p>Business Week magazine said these are the kind of results
    that you want. Lower inflation, lower interest rates, more jobs
    and more growth, all within the context of a balanced
    budget.</p>
    <p>We have reduced the budget deficit four years in a row. We
    have cut it down 60 percent. After it went up by almost 300
    percent during the previous two administrations.</p>
    <p>Now, this is the kind of growth we want more of. We think we
    can do much better still. That's why we are pushing these
    income tax cuts for middle-income families in the context of a
    balanced budget that protects important programs.</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: Four years too late. You told us that four years
    ago, and we still don't have it. How can we trust an
    administration that all of a sudden four years into, or the
    last year of its four years, tells us that now they are going
    to follow through on the promise they made four years ago?</p>
    <p>This economy is not growing fast enough. The have's are
    doing well, but, Jim, the have not's are not doing well. There
    are people hurting. There are families that can't stay
    together. Jobs are not being created. And the unemployment rate
    in our nation's inner cities is somewhere between 16 and 25
    percent. That's morally and socially unacceptable in a modern
    day economy.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. Vice President, Senator Dole raised the same
    question to President Clinton the other night about keeping
    promises made.</p>
    <p>What is your reaction to that, What is your response to that
    charge against you and the President?</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: President Bill Clinton promised to
    create 8 million jobs. He has created 10-and-a-half million new
    jobs.</p>
    <p>He promised to cut the budget deficit in half. He has cut it
    by 60 percent. He promised to end welfare as we know it. He
    passed and signed the welfare reform law. He has already moved
    1.9 million people off the welfare rolls, into good jobs.</p>
    <p>We have got a plan to move 1 million more off welfare during
    the next four years. He promised to implement the death
    penalty. We passed an anti-crime bill that has 60 new death
    penalty provisions.</p>
    <p>He promised to pass a plan that would put 100,000 new police
    officers on the streets. It is law, over the opposition of
    Senator Dole and 20,000 of them are already on the streets.
    2,000 of them have been funded already for here in Florida.</p>
    <p>We are ahead of schedule and we are going to get the
    additional 80,000 new police officers on the streets in the
    coming four years.</p>
    <p>45,000 of them are now already funded. That is a record of
    promises made and promises kept. He promised middle income tax
    cuts.</p>
    <p>We have cut taxes for 15 million families and our plan to
    cut them for all middle-income families has been waiting for
    action in the Congress for two full years.</p>
    <p>In the next four years, we will pass it.</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: Well, to say that this is the best economy in 30
    years staggers the imagination. We have a growth rate in the
    last four years of about 2.5 percent. My friend Al Gore says it
    is better than the Reagan years. It isn't.</p>
    <p>But irrespective of whether he thinks it is or not, means
    less than the fact that this country cannot morally and
    socially and economically accept an economy running out the
    clock on the 20th century. We are treading water. We have
    families that are hurting. We have people who are unemployed.
    We have people with no property. We have an administration that
    is demolishing public housing in our inner cities and not
    providing anything else but more public housing.</p>
    <p>Their solution to the inner city is more, excuse the
    expression, but it is true, socialism. It is not for the
    people. It is for the government to tell them where to live,
    where to go to school. We need school choice. We need to
    privatize public housing. We need to sell it to the residents.
    We need to put enterprise zones in America and we need to lower
    the rates of taxation on labor, capital and the factors of
    production. That will happen under Bob Dole.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: We are demolishing the outdated
    projects that did not work and we are replacing them with new
    units that do work. We have private vouchers so individuals can
    choose for themselves where they live and we are selling these
    units to many of those who want to buy them.</p>
    <p>Mr. Kemp had a good idea when he advocated that years ago.
    He talked about it, we did it. And we are going to do a lot
    more of it if we have the opportunity with the help of the
    American people.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. Kemp, some are saying these days something
    has gone terribly wrong with the American soul, that we have
    become too mean, too selfish, too uncaring; and the spitting
    incident, how it was handled, the baseball players used as a
    recent example. What do you think about that?</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: Civility, responsibility, racial reconciliation,
    healing the wounds of our country has to be one of the
    greatest, most singularly important goals for this country here
    on the edge of the 21st Century.</p>
    <p>How in the name of American Democracy can we say to Eastern
    Europe that democratic capitalism will work there if we can't
    make it work in East L.A. or East Harlem or East Palo Alto,
    California. How can we tell South Africa, the new Mandela
    government that democracy and private property, rule of law and
    civility will work there if it is not working in our own
    backyard here at home or in the South Bronx?</p>
    <p>How can America go into the next century and leave so many
    people behind? U.S.A. Today a few weeks ago did a study, they
    said the affluent are doing very well in America. The have's,
    but the have not's and the poor are being left behind.</p>
    <p>It is a giant, in my opinion, zero-sum gain, kind of like
    musical chairs when we were young boys and girls growing up and
    it seemed like when the music stopped, the big guy elbowed out
    the little guy from the last chair. That is not America. We
    need more chairs. We need a bigger table. We need a greater
    banquet, we need to create more wealth and create more jobs and
    more access to credit and capital and choice and opportunity
    for any man or woman and child to be what God meant them to be,
    not what Washington, D.C. wants them to be.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: I think, Mr. Lehrer, that throughout
    much of his career, Jack Kemp has been a powerful and needed
    voice against the kind of coarseness and incivility that you
    referred to in the question.</p>
    <p>I think it is an extremely valuable service to have a voice
    within the Republican Party who says we ought to be one nation.
    We ought to cross all of the racial and ethnic and cultural
    barriers. I think that is a very important message to
    deliver.</p>
    <p>And we ought to speak out against these violations of
    civility when they do occur. You asked about the incident
    involving Roberto Alomar. I won't hesitate to tell you what I
    think. I think he should have been severely disciplined,
    suspended, perhaps, immediately. I don't understand why that
    action was not taken.</p>
    <p>But the same could be said of so many incidents in all kinds
    of institutions in our society, but I complement Mr. Kemp for
    the leadership he has shown in moving us away from that kind of
    attitude.</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: Well, I thank you, Al. I mean that very, very
    sincerely, but I am trying to make a bigger point. That
    civility cannot return to our country unless every person feels
    that they have an equal shot at the American dream. If you are
    born in this country to be a mezzo soprano or a master
    carpenter or a school teacher like my daughter or professional
    football quarterback, nothing should be in your way.</p>
    <p>Removing those barriers is what Bob Dole is all about,
    moving our country forward and leaving no one behind.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. Vice President, do you agree with that
    thesis, that in order to solve the problem of civility, the
    problems of the American soul, it is an economic problem more
    than it is something else?</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: I think economics is one of the single
    most important parts of this problem. That's why we are
    focusing on tax credits to hire 1 million more people coming
    off welfare in the inner city.</p>
    <p>That's why we are focusing on an economic policy that has
    already created ten-and-a-half million new jobs and is going to
    create millions more within the context, again, of a balanced
    budget that protects important programs.</p>
    <p>We have focused especially on the most distressed areas,
    because we cannot leave anyone behind. Our empowerment zones
    and enterprise communities, the tax credits that will encourage
    the formation of new businesses, the new approach by the Small
    Business Administration to get more loans out to individuals
    that have not had equal access to capital in the past, these
    are parts of the plan.</p>
    <p>Another part of it is the community development financial
    institutions. And the law that says deposits that are made in a
    community, in the inner cities, say, should be kept in the
    community, not entirely, but some percentage of them should be
    kept there.</p>
    <p>That prevents that money being taken from the community and
    invest it in some go-go investment on the other side of the
    world and when they invest in the community, they find that
    there is a better payback rate, more small businesses are
    created, and the community improves.</p>
    <p>That's happening in America today, not fast enough, but
    faster than before and we think we can accelerate it with our
    plan.</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: There really is no separation between a strong
    community and a strong economy. And you can't have a strong
    economy without strong communities and small families. The word
    economics in Greek came from the word family or law or custom
    of the family.</p>
    <p>A family without a job, where both bread winners are away
    from home and cannot spend time with their children or can't
    send a child to the school of their choice, rather than just
    the choice of the federal bureaucracy cannot possibly be as
    strong as a family that has the nurture, the love, the dignity
    and the justice that goes along with one bread winner, a strong
    job and if that man or woman wants to work, it is their choice,
    not just to pay taxes.</p>
    <p>We need both, we need strong communities, strong schools,
    schools that nurture the type of discipline and respect from
    teachers and parents and Bob Dole wants to empower the public
    school districts and the teachers, not the federal bureaucracy
    at the Department of Education.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: Senator Dole has said that he wants to
    abolish the Department of Education. He voted against the
    creation of Head Start. He vigorously opposed the Family and
    Medical Leave Act, which was the first law that President
    Clinton signed as President.</p>
    <p>Now Senator Dole has suggested that he would repeal the
    Family and Medical Leave Act, if he had the chance, if he was
    elected President. We believe in more educational opportunity
    and measures to strengthen families, not restrict their access
    to education.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Speaking of the family, where do you come out on
    that, Mr. Kemp, do you believe it should be repealed, the
    Family Leave Act?</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: I wouldn't have voted for it. It is in place.
    Their answer, this administration, to every single problem is
    another regulation and another tax.</p>
    <p>Clearly in America, I am astounded to think that you can
    have a strong Family Leave Act or policy by a business if they
    are not making a profit.</p>
    <p>If there aren't a lot of jobs, if there isn't the type of
    policies that will enhance the formation of the seed corn and
    the oxygen and the capital that will allow that company to not
    only retain that profit, but invest it.</p>
    <p>As I said earlier Dana Crist of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, who
    runs a small, little manufacturing or distribution center in
    Lancaster, said she as an entrepreneur would start a whole new
    factory if the Federal Government would cut the cost of
    capital.</p>
    <p>She wants the capital gains rate reduced.</p>
    <p>And to Al Gore and Bill Clinton, that is somehow
    trickle-down economics. Tell it to Dana Crist. Tell it to Van
    Woods. Tell it to the men and woman that I met in South
    Central. Tell it to anybody who understands how to make
    democratic capitalism work.</p>
    <p>I want to say one more time, the real excitement of a
    Dole-Kemp administration would be to get out of this current
    Tax Code and that redistributes wealth and create a brand new
    system for the 21st Century that is pro-family, pro-growth and
    stops the double, triple and quadruple taxation of income from
    work, savings, investment and entrepreneurial risk taking in
    America.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: The question as I recall it was about
    family and medical leave. Here is how it works. If you have a
    child who is critically ill or has been seriously injured and
    you have to stay with that child in the hospital, some
    employers have said you can't take too much time off in spite
    of these circumstances.</p>
    <p>I personally know people who have been fired because they
    made the choice to be with their child. Don't tell me this
    doesn't happen. It happens all across the United States.</p>
    <p>But since Bill Clinton made this the first law he signed, it
    has been used 12 million times by American families to
    reconcile the demands of work with the responsibilities to the
    family.</p>
    <p>We now want to extend it to PTA meetings and scheduled
    doctors appointments. It shouldn't be repealed. It ought to be
    extended. 75 percent of businesses who have had experience with
    it say they like it. It works.</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: It was here before Bill Clinton and it will be
    here after Bill Clinton. Senator Tsongas a good friend of
    Senator Gore, Vice President Gore suggested that he was afraid
    his party was falling into the trap of loving the employee, but
    hating the employer. You cannot love labor and hate employers.
    You cannot drive this wedge between workers and management.</p>
    <p>And businesses who are providing family leave, they will
    continue, they should, but they have to make a profit and the
    tax on business, capital, labor and families is too high and we
    want to reduce that regulatory burden and that tax burden in a
    new Dole-Kemp administration.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Gentlemen, that was the last question. So now we
    go to the closing statements. There will be three minutes each
    and Mr. Kemp, you are first.</p>
    <p>MR. KEMP: Thank you, Jim and thanks to the people of St.
    Petersburg for a fantastic hospitality and my friend, Al Gore,
    for a vigorous debate.</p>
    <p>I think this is the most exciting time in the history of the
    world to be alive. We have lived through what Jeanne
    Kirkpatrick called �the bloodiest century in mankind's
    history�. We have defeated in this system of ours, fascism,
    Nazism, communism. Socialism is defunct or debunk around the
    world. The evil of apartheid has ended.</p>
    <p>There is only one last question remaining for the next
    century, indeed the next millennium. Can we in America make the
    world's greatest liberal democracy, this democratic experiment,
    in private property, limited government, the rule of law,
    respect for families and traditional Judeo Christian values
    work so it can be a blessing to our country and a blessing to
    the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>With all due respect to this administration, they have got a
    foreign policy in disarray. They have a lack of credibility
    around the world. Weakness, I said earlier, is provocative and
    clearly this economy is not performing up to the standards that
    we would expect from this great nation going into the most
    exciting global economy the world has ever known.</p>
    <p>There is something amiss. Our culture seems on to be
    weakening all around us. Families are under tremendous
    pressure. People do not feel safe in their homes. A mother
    doesn't feel safe sending their child to school. Our schools
    are not educating.</p>
    <p>It is not the problem with the teachers. They are overworked
    and, my daughter will tell you, they are underpaid and we know
    that.</p>
    <p>They need to be empowered. We need to reform education. We
    need to reform welfare. We need to reform litigation and
    regulation. And we certainly need to reform this tax code that
    is a product of this terrible century of war and recession and
    inflation. It can be done. We need somebody who understands the
    potential of the American people, who are not just doing well
    for ourselves, we need to do well for the rest of the world
    because they are looking at us and we need to make it work in
    every neighborhood and community in America and for every
    family, so that no one, as Bob Dole said in his San Diego
    acceptance speech, is left behind.</p>
    <p>Bob Dole, as I said earlier, is a man of courage, a man of
    principles, a man who crawled out of a foxhole on Riva's Ridge
    in 1945 to save a wounded brethren. The Bible said no greater
    love hast the man than to give his life. Well, Bob did, just
    about. He had been to the valley of the shadow. And he as
    Commander in Chief can take this country with the courage of
    Churchill, the principle of Lincoln and the indefatigable
    optimism and spirit that this nation expects from its commander
    this chief, the next President of the United States, Bob
    Dole.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Mr. Vice President.</p>
    <p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: Thank you very much, Mr. Lehrer. Thanks
    again to the people of St. Petersburg and thanks again to Jack
    Kemp. I have enormous respect for Jack Kemp and for Bob
    Dole.</p>
    <p>They are good men. I don't agree with their plan. I have
    tried to make that clear tonight. One reason I have tried to
    make it clear is that in just 27 days the United States of
    America has an important choice to make between two approaches
    to the future of this country.</p>
    <p>We have a plan that will create millions more jobs, bring
    the deficits down further and balance the budget, while
    protecting Medicare, protecting Medicaid, protecting and
    preserving the environment, our air, our water, the Everglades,
    the Tongass, the Mohave Desert in California, the Utah Red
    Rocks area, all of which has been protected by President Bill
    Clinton.</p>
    <p>We also have a plan to expand access to education. There is
    a family in the audience tonight, the McNeil family, who lives
    right here in St.Petersburg, both parents are teachers. They
    are not rich in money, but they have strong values and they
    value education.</p>
    <p>Their oldest son is a freshman at St. Petersburg Junior
    College. Their younger son, Rod is a sophomore in the same high
    school Don McNeil teaches at.</p>
    <p>Roderick is concerned he may not be able to get the tuition
    he needs to go to college when the time comes.</p>
    <p>Our plan gives a $1500 tax credit to make that junior
    college essentially free. And a $10,000 tax deduction to make
    it so that no American family or almost no family will have to
    pay taxes on the money they pay for college tuition.</p>
    <p>This plan also gives tax breaks on the sale of a home, up to
    $500,000 in profit tax free. It gives a new break for
    first-time home buyers and, again, all in the context of a
    balanced budget.</p>
    <p>We have seen progress during the last four years because
    policies like these have been working. This risky scheme that I
    have described tonight has been said by many objective
    observers to not add up. It would be a serious risk.</p>
    <p>Our plan by contrast has been working and will work more. We
    want to build a bridge to the 21st Century. And we want it to
    be strong enough and broad enough for all families to cross and
    we want it to lead to a brighter future for America because our
    best days are ahead.</p>
    <p>MR. LEHRER: Thank you.<br>
