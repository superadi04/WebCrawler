              Georgia is the country�s 20th largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $763 million in
              agricultural exports abroad or 1.8% of the U.S. total
              in 1994 (latest year available for Department of
              Agriculture state export data). The largest export
              categories, poultry, cotton, peanuts, and tobacco,
              accounted for over 65 percent of Georgia�s
              agricultural exports in 1994. Given the 22 percent
              increase in total U.S. agriculture exports in 1995,
              agriculture exports from Georgia in 1995 will likely
              range between $900 million and $950 million.
