              Louisiana is the country�s 24th largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $579 million in
              agricultural exports abroad or 1.3% of the U.S. total
              in 1994 (latest year available for Department of
              Agriculture state export data). The largest export
              categories, cotton and linters, and rice, accounted
              for half of Louisiana� agricultural exports in 1994.
              Given the 22 percent increase in total U.S.
              agriculture exports in 1995, agriculture exports from
              Louisiana in 1995 will likely range between $690
              million and $720 million.
