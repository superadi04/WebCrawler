    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    October 31, 1996</tt>
    <center>
      <tt><b>STATEMENT BY JOE LOCKHART<br>
      NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>President Clinton has proposed a common ground, balanced
    budget plan that would extend the Medicare trust fund 10 years,
    providing enough time for a bipartisan process to address
    Medicare�s long-term solvency.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>In contrast to this responsible approach, the
    Dole/Gingrich 1995 budget would have cut Medicare by $270
    billion, placed a higher burden on providers and beneficiaries,
    and put hundreds of the nation�s most vulnerable hospitals at
    risk. Elderly couples would have paid $1,700 in higher Medicare
    premiums by 2002. Bob Dole�s current $548 billion risky tax
    scheme would double the bet -- jeopardizing Medicare in the
    short term -- and throwing a wrecking ball at Medicare long
    before bipartisan solutions could be reached.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton believes Medicare should be built up
    as it�s fixed, not torn down for risky tax cuts.</tt></p>
