    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    October 25, 1996</tt>
    <center>
      <tt><b>PRESIDENT CLINTON KICKS OFF CAMPAIGN�S YOUTH VOTER
      EFFORT, STRESSES IMPORTANCE OF YOUNG AMERICANS� POLITICAL
      INVOLVEMENT</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>Today, in Atlanta, President Clinton issued a challenge
    to younger Americans -- those under 35 -- to plug into the
    political process, to become active, to get involved in their
    communities, and to vote for the Clinton/Gore ticket.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The President�s address coincided with the Clinton/Gore
    campaign�s announcement of its National Youth Steering
    Committee and 23 State Youth Advisory Committees.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>At a Clinton/Gore rally in Woodruff Park, the President
    framed the upcoming election as a choice between two Americas
    -- one that looks forward toward increased economic
    opportunity, improved educational standards, and a renewed
    sense of community, or one that looks backward to an era of
    bloated budgets, skyrocketing debt and deficits, economic
    disparity and declining living standards. The President called
    on younger Americans to help him build a bridge to the 21st
    century. The President also addressed the importance of
    national service and challenged younger Americans to serve
    their communities and their country.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"The President understands the concerns of younger
    voters and believes that his re-election is the best hope
    younger voters have to secure their economic and social
    future," said Nicole Boxer-Rodham, Coordinator of Youth
    Outreach for the Clinton/Gore campaign. "This campaign is about
    the future vs. the past. Younger voters have a clear choice: do
    we want to stay on track with a healthy economy, lower interest
    rates, more jobs, lower crime rates, education for all
    Americans, and a clean and healthy environment, or do we want
    to return to the failed policies of the past?"</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The Clinton-Gore Administration has been and continues
    to be committed to real next generation issues such as the
    deficit, economic growth, education, the environment and the
    fight against violent crime.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The Clinton-Gore Administration remains committed to
    tackling the long range economic challenges facing younger
    Americans and stressing the importance of the next generation�s
    involvement in the political process.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The Clinton-Gore Administration has strengthened and
    expanded America�s economy. The deficit has been cut by 60
    percent; more than 10.5 million new jobs have been created; we
    have the lowest unemployment rate in over six years; and
    interest rates on car loans and home mortgages are the lowest
    in three decades.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"More young people volunteer today than ever before in
    our nation�s history, they are to be commended for their
    efforts in their communities, but they need to be reminded that
    they can have the same impact on National elections. President
    Clinton reminded them of that today in Atlanta and offered
    younger Americans a reason to participate. Our generation has a
    say in what happens to America -- we have choices to make and
    it�s important to exercise them, beginning with this election,
    by making a choice for our future -- a choice for
    Clinton-Gore," said Boxer-Rodham.</tt></p>
