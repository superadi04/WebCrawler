    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    September 26, 1996</tt>
    <p><tt>STATEMENT BY JOE LOCKHART<br>
    NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY</tt></p>
    <p><tt>In his new ad, Bob Dole is resorting to insults over
    ideas.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The Truth about the Clinton Record: he's the first
    President to cut the deficit for four consecutive years since
    before the Civil War. Under 3 and 1/2 years of President
    Clinton, the deficit has been cut by 60 percent. The
    President's 1993 Economic Plan cut federal spending by $255
    billion -- one of the largest spending cut packages in history.
    Spending as a share of the economy has declined from 23.3% to
    21.7% of GDP and is lower than at any time during the previous
    two Administrations -- lower than any year since 1979. The
    federal workforce has been reduced by nearly 250,000 workers to
    its lowest level since President Kennedy.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton�s CBO certified balanced budget cuts
    spending by an additional $500 billion more over the next six
    years and protects our values. Also, he has signed a welfare
    reform bill that will save $60 billion.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Now let�s take a peek at Bob Dole�s record. Bob Dole
    voted for over $900 billion in new taxes over 35 years in
    Congress. When Bob Dole was a Republican Leader -- as Senate
    Finance Committee Chairman and Senate Majority Leader -- from
    1980 to 1986, the deficit tripled. Worse, his risky $548
    billion economic scheme would blow a hole in the deficit and
    actually raise taxes on nine million working
    Americans.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole had an interesting idea with his ad today. Too
    bad, it�s the ad Republican Steve Forbes ran about Bob Dole in
    the 1996 Republican Presidential primaries.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Recall: "A choice for Republicans in wasteful spending.
    Should Congress have spent six million dollars of taxpayers
    money for an Idaho ski resort? ...Bob Dole voted Yes. Should
    Congress have spent 2 1/2 million dollars of taxpayers' money
    to build bicycle paths in North Miami Beach? Bob Dole voted
    Yes. ...Bob Dole -- Washington values."</tt></p>

    <p><tt>"A choice for Republicans on wasteful spending. Should
    Congress have spent six million dollars of taxpayers' money for
    an Idaho ski resort? Steve Forbes says No. Bob Dole voted Yes.
    Should Congress have spent 2 1/2 million dollars of taxpayers'
    money to build bicycle paths in North Miami Beach? Steve Forbes
    says No. Bob Dole voted Yes. Two men -- different values. Bob
    Dole -- Washington values. Steve Forbes -- Conservative
    values." [Forbes release, 1/3/96 as quoted in Hotline,
    1/4/96]</tt></p>

    Television</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"A choice for Republicans on wasteful spending. Should
    Congress have spent $18 million for a new subway to run three
    blocks from senators' offices to the Capitol? Steve Forbes says
    no, it was wasteful spending. Bob Dole says yes. Bob Dole voted
    for a new subway to run three blocks from senators' offices to
    the Capitol. Two men. Different values. Bob Dole -- Washington
    values. Steve Forbes -- conservative values." [Associated
    Press, 12/13/95]</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Dole�s Taxes<br>
    :30<br>
    Television</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Announcer: "Since 1982, Bob Dole has voted for tax
    increases, raising income taxes, taxes on phones, gas, even
    Social Security. A total of 962 billion dollars in tax
    increases."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Steve Forbes: "I'm Steve Forbes. I disagree with Bob
    Dole. We need a flat tax that's a tax cut. It's simple. It's
    honest. And that's a big change for Washington."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Announcer: "Steve Forbes for President."[Transcribed
    from video, NBC, 11/5/95. First aired, 11/2/95]</tt></p>
