    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    September 24, 1996</tt>
    <p><tt>STATEMENT BY JOE LOCKHART</tt></p>
    <p><tt>NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Instead of offering any new ideas today, Bob Dole did
    what he does best. He went negative -- attacking what he
    himself called "the best economy in 30 years" during the
    Republican primaries. In a sign of desperation, Dole chose fear
    over facts. But the facts speak clearly: the deficit has been
    cut by 60 percent, there are 10 1/2 million new jobs;
    unemployment is at a seven year low; and taxes were cut for 15
    million working families.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Furthermore, President Clinton's economic plan helped
    create the best home ownership rate in 15 years; more women
    owned businesses than ever before; and for the first time in
    nearly two decades, America, once again, leads the world in
    auto production. Growth in the private sector under President
    Clinton (3.2%) is stronger than either President Reagan (3.0%)
    or Bush (1.3%). And despite Dole�s unfounded attacks the fact
    is that the federal workforce is smaller under President
    Clinton than it has been since the beginning of Bob Dole�s
    congressional career -- which began under President
    Kennedy.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole said one thing today that is true. He said, "in
    politics...you can�t run from your record." So let�s take a
    look at Bob Dole�s record. In the 1960s, Dole voted against
    creating Medicare, against creating student loans, against
    creating the Clean Water Act, against creating Head Start, and
    against creating the Peace Corps. In the 1970s, Dole voted
    against creating the Department of Education and against a
    higher minimum wage. In the 1980s, Dole voted against creating
    a drug czar but voted for the largest peacetime tax increase in
    history. In the 1990s, Dole voted against Family & Medical
    Leave, against the Brady Bill and in 1995, Dole and Gingrich
    tried to cut Medicare by $270 billion.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>And while Bob Dole was trying again today to revive his
    discredited economic plan, 546 prominent economists --
    including seven Nobel Laureates -- charged that Dole�s plan was
    "not credible" and "would be a lowering of future living
    standards." The truth is, despite Dole�s negative attacks, the
    economy is on the right track. Bob Dole�s plan would send it
    off the track, blow a hole in the deficit and lead to deeper
    cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment --
    even deeper than last year�s Dole/Gingrich budget.</tt></p>
