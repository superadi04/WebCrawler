<P>Concord Coalition to Run Ad Warning Against Tax Cuts

 Concord Coalition to Run Full Page Ad Warning Against Return to
Supply-Side Tax Cuts
 <br>To: National Desk
<BR> Contact: Jamie Ridge of the Concord Coalition, 202-467-6222

<P>   WASHINGTON, Aug. 2 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The Concord Coalition has
purchased a full-page advertisement in this Sunday's New York Times
that warns against a return to the supply-side tax policies of the
1980s.
<P>   The advertisement, which will appear in the form of an open letter
to the American people, is signed by Concord Coalition founders Paul
Tsongas, Warren Rudman and Pete Peterson.
<P>   "Let the 1980s be a lesson.  The original supply-side concept of
targeted tax cuts quickly led to a general tax cut bidding war, with
both parties joining in the frenzy," the ad states.  "This resulted
in unprecedented peacetime deficits and interest costs that will be
with us for years to come."
<P>   Rather than supply-side tax cuts, the ad urges political
candidates to focus on long-term economic growth and entitlement
spending reforms that will prepare the country for the retirement of
the massive baby boom generation.
<P>   "America ought to be preparing right now for this fast-
approaching demographic gauntlet by saving and investing more on
behalf of young workers," the letter states.  "To make this possible,
we should eliminate the deficit by the year 2002 -- as the president
and Congress agreed last year -- and even plan to run a budget
surplus through at least the first decade of the next century.
Today's budget problems are tough enough.  Let's not make tomorrow's
impossible."
 <P>  The Concord Coalition was founded in 1992 by former Sens. Rudman
(R-N.H.) and Tsongas (D-Mass.) and former Secretary of Commerce
Peterson.  The Coalition has more than 170,000 members nationwide and
grassroots chapters in each state and most congressional districts.
  <P> The full text of the ad follows.

    <P><CENTER>              IT'S TOO EARLY FOR CHRISTMAS
</center>
<P>   To the American People:

  <P> Voters beware!  Candidates are gearing up for their election year
sales pitch, which means we'll be hearing plenty of promises that are
too good to be true.  This time around, it looks like a large yet
"fiscally responsible" tax cut will be heading our
Christmas-in-Summer wish list.
<P>   How can a big tax cut be responsible when the federal budget is
already running a deficit and tomorrow's deficits are scheduled to
fly higher than Santa's reindeer?  The answer is it can't.  It's not
the right season to celebrate Christmas.  Likewise, it's not the
right year to advocate a big tax cut.

<p><CENTER>       BIG TAX CUTS DON'T PAY FOR THEMSELVES: BEWARE THE
              "ROSY SCENARIOS" AND TECHNICAL VOODOO
</CENTER>
 <p>  Some say large tax cuts can pay for themselves.  This is not so.
Although most economists concede that certain targeted cuts (such as
a small reduction in the top marginal income tax rate or business tax
incentives) might be largely self-financing, these cuts don't add up
to a lot of money or growth.  More important, since they must be
targeted toward businesses and affluent households, neither the
Republicans nor the Democrats -- as a practical matter -- can propose
them without also offering a much larger cut to the broad middle
class.  And no mainstream economist believes that such an
across-the-board cut will come anywhere near close to paying for
itself.
  <p> In fact, despite all the hoopla about "dynamic scoring" and the
related claim that the economy will grow like topsy, the most
seasoned policymakers admit no one can be sure of the direction, much
less the magnitude, of the economy's response to most tax cuts.
Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker has warned that dynamic scoring is
"an invitation to wishful thinking." Current Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan worries that it could cause "financial markets to lose
confidence in the integrity of our budget scoring procedures," and
that "the rise in inflation premiums and interest rates could more
than offset any statistical difference between so- called static and
more dynamic scoring."
<p>   Let the 1980s be a lesson.  The orginal supply-side concept of
targeted tax cuts quickly led to a general tax cut bidding war, with
both parties joining in the frenzy.  This resulted in unprecedented
peacetime deficits and interest costs that will be with us for years
to come.  This year alone, interest payments will come to $240
billion, or almost twice the size of the entire deficit.  Those who
swear by dynamic scoring would do well to remember that the last time
we relied on this sort of technical voodoo its proponents assumed
that GDP would group by $2.1 trillion more than it really did over
the next five years.  Let's not replay the rosy scenario.

<p><CENTER>          LONG-TERM SPENDING CONTROL MUST COME FIRST --
     WHICH MEANS MAKING THE INDISPENSIBLE CUTS IN OUR GIANT
                MIDDLE-CLASS ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS
</CENTER>
  <p> Some say we can easily pay for a big tax cut by reducing federal
spending.  But where?  Over the last 10 years, discretionary spending
on everything from education to defense has already shrunk from 10.0
percent to 7.1 percent of GDP.  So deep are these cuts that even the
Republican Congress cannot reach consensus on further savings.  If we
are serious about cutting spending, the big areas to focus on are
middle class entitlements like Social Security and Medicare, and, in
addition, Medicaid.  Entitlements are now 11.7 percent of GDP and
climbing on autopilot.  Yet here Congress and the White House aren't
willing to seize the controls.  America's leaders will have to show a
lot more courage on spending before we earn the right to cut taxes.
<p>   Any political candidate who wants to be responsible to our
national future would do well to spell out cuts in spending and
corporate tax loopholes that could pay for a tax cut.  But if these
belt-tightening policies pay for the tax cut, they can't be used
later to balance the budget.  Even in Washington, money can be spent
only once.

<p><CENTER>  THE LONG-TERM PERIL: TRILLION-DOLLAR-PLUS SOCIAL SECURITY AND
MEDICARE DEFICITS
</CENTER>
  <p> Some say the federal deficit is declining.  That good news is true
today, but it won't be true tomorrow.  We cannot expect that the
world will indefinitely remain as peaceful and recession-free as it
is today.  We know for certain that today's favorable demographics
cannot last much longer.  For the next dozen years a large ("Boom")
generation will be swelling the ranks of workers and taxpayers while
a small ("Depression") generation will be retiring.  But when the 76
million Baby Boomers become the Senior Boomers, look out: all
official projections show that entitlement spending and the deficit
will explode.  By the year 2030, the yearly deficit just for Social
Security and Medicare Hospital Insurance alone is officially
projected to amount to $1.8 trillion.  Yes, we said trillion!
<p>   America ought to be preparing right now for this fast approaching
demographic gauntlet by saving and investing ore on behalf of young
workers.  To make this possible, we should eliminate the deficit by
the year 2002 -- as the president and Congress agreed last year --
and even plan to run a budget surplus through at least the first
decade of the next century.  Today's budget problems are tough
enough.  Let's not make tomorrow's impossible.

<p><CENTER>STRONGER ECONOMIC AND PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH REQUIRES SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT -- A BIG TAX CUT WOULD TAKE US IN THE
OPPOSITE DIRECTION
</CENTER>
  <p> Some say that for want of a tax cut the U.S. economy is under-
performing.  By unleashing work and entrepreneurial effort, they say,
the economy could double its real growth rate.  Aside from the great
leap of faith that tax cuts can do this unleashing, their argument
overlooks basic arithmetic: Economic growth is the sum of employment
growth (number of workers) and productivity growth (output per
worker).  No finagling with the tax code will make the workforce grow
as fast as it once did.  The share of women in the work force is
unlikely to rise much higher.  Since the 1960s, we've been having
fewer children, which means that fewer new workers will be entering
the job market.  And no one is suggesting sizable increases in
immigration, legal or otherwise.  Thus, even if we did enjoy the same
rate of productivity growth as in earlier post-war decades -- which
we don't -- the economy still wouldn't be growing as fast.
<p>   The Concord Coalition has always been in favor of genuine and
sustainable economic growth -- the kind that requires increased
productivity, the ultimate foundation for any lasting improvement in
living standards.  But how do we increase productivity?  The only
certain way is by improving the tools, research and education at the
disposal of American workers.  This in turn requires that we generate
the savings needed to pay for these investments.  Tax cuts that jack
up the deficit and encourage households to increase their immediate
consumption, are not the way to raise savings.

<P><CENTER>                       CHRISTMAS CAN WAIT
</CENTER>
<P>   The tax cut Santas distract us from our real challenge: ensuring
that federal fiscal policies are sustainable over the long run, and
that they endow the young as much as they reward the old.  Yes, there
is a time to celebrate Christmas.  That's after we've used our Indian
Summer wisely.  That's after we've harvested our crops, set aside our
seed corn, stocked our larders and provided for our own and our
children's future.  Christmas can wait until then.  And so can a tax
cut.
