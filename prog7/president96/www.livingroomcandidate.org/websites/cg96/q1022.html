    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    October 22, 1996</tt>
    <center>
      <tt><b>STATEMENT BY ANN LEWIS<br>
      DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole�s former Finance Committee Vice Chairman Simon
    Fireman is scheduled to be sentenced to six months in jail
    tomorrow for illegally funneling money through a Hong Kong bank
    to the Dole campaign. Fireman has already agreed to pay a
    record $6 million fine. In addition, federal agents are
    currently investigating similar money schemes undertaken by
    DeLuca Liquor & Wine of Nevada and Empire Landfill of
    Pennsylvania that are linked to the Dole campaign
    (<u>Washington Post</u>, 4/25/96; <u>K.C. Star</u>
    10/21/96).</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Given Bob Dole�s current election-year campaign finance
    conversion, here are a few questions for him on his own
    campaign finance record:</tt></p>
    <p><tt>1) Why did your running-mate Jack Kemp mislead the
    American people by claiming on national television that you
    fired your Vice Chairman after his illegal actions on behalf of
    your campaign were discovered, when, in fact, you never fired
    or even suspended Fireman? (<u>K.C. Star</u>,
    10/21/96)</tt></p>
    <p><tt>2) Why haven�t you made Simon Fireman available to the
    press to answer questions about his illegal fundraising scheme
    on your behalf?</tt></p>
    <p><tt>3) Why won�t you make your staff fundraisers who raised
    the money from Simon Fireman, Empire Landfill, and DeLuca
    Liquor available to the press to answer questions about these
    illegal schemes to raise funds for your Presidential
    campaign?</tt></p>
    <p><tt>4) Have you returned the nearly $50,000 that your
    campaign received from Empire Landfill and the over $10,000
    that your campaign received from DeLuca Liquor & Wine? (<u>Wall
    Street Journal</u>, 5/8/96; <u>K.C. Star,</u>
    9/29/96).</tt></p>
    <p><tt>5) Do you expect Haley Barbour and Newt Gingrich to
    resign from their jobs? Each said that they would stake their
    jobs on the fact that the RNC had not accepted money from
    foreign nationals or a foreign company. Yet yesterday�s <u>Roll
    Call</u> reported that the RNC just returned an illegal $15,000
    check from a Canadian company. (<u>Roll Call</u>,
    10/21/96)</tt></p>
