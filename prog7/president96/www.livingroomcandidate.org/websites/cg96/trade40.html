              Maryland is the country�s 35th largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $178 million in
              agricultural exports abroad in 1994 (latest year
              available for Department of Agriculture state export
              data). The largest export categories, poultry,
              soybeans and feed grains, accounted for over 75
              percent of Maryland�s agricultural exports in 1994.
              Given the 22 percent increase in total U.S.
              agriculture exports in 1995, agriculture exports from
              Maryland in 1995 will likely range between $200
              million and $220 million.
