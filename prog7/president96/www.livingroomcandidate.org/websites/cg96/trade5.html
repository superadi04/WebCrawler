              Maine is the country�s 41st largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $43 million in agricultural
              exports abroad in 1994 (latest year available for
              Department of Agriculture state export data). The
              largest export category, vegetables, accounted for
              over 60 percent of Maine�s agricultural exports in
              1995. Given the 22 percent increase in total U.S.
              agriculture exports in 1995, agriculture exports from
              Maine in 1995 will likely range between $48 million
              and $55 million.
