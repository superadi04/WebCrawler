    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    October 7, 1996</tt>
    <p><tt><b>STATEMENT BY JOE LOCKHART<br>
    NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY</b></tt></p>
    <p><tt>In a campaign flashback, Bob Dole is warning people of a
    Democratic plot to scare senior citizens about the effects of
    his economic scheme on Medicare. Senior citizens have a right
    to be scared.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>In 1994, Bob Dole chastised Democrats for telling
    Americans about a Republican plan to cut Medicare. He accused
    the President saying, "In a state of near panic, President
    Clinton and Vice President Gore are resorting to scare tactics.
    They�re falsely accusing Republicans of secret plans to cut
    Social Security and Medicare benefits ..." (Radio address,
    Federal News Service, 11/5/94) Yet after Republicans took
    control of Congress, what did Bob Dole do? In 1995, Bob Dole
    and Newt Gingrich tried to cut Medicare, offering a budget that
    would have reduced Medicare by $270 billion to pay for $245 in
    tax cuts. It�s 1996 and Bob Dole has proposed an economic
    scheme that doubles the tax cut bet to $548 billion. What will
    Bob Dole do to pay for it?</tt></p>
    <p><tt>They say "history repeats itself" and since Bob Dole
    won�t tell the American public what he will cut to pay for his
    scheme, Americans must let "history be their guide."</tt></p>
