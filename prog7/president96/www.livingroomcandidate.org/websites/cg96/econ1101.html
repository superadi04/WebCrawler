      <tt><b>STATEMENT BY JOE LOCKHART<br>
      NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>Today, Bob Dole made clear he�d like to take us back to
    the Dole/Bush economy while President Clinton�s economic
    leadership continues to set us on the right track for the 21st
    century.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>There is more good economic news today. Americans are
    enjoying the lowest unemployment rate in 7 years, an additional
    250,000 new private sector jobs have been created, and America
    now has a better annual rate of job growth than under any
    Republican Administration since the 1920s.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Here are the facts:</tt></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>For 26 consecutive months, the unemployment rate has
      been below 6%. Unemployment is the lowest in 7 years -- a
      lower average rate than during any Administration in 20
      years.</tt></p>
      <p><tt>America now has the highest home ownership rate in 15
      years and the lowest average mortgage rates than under any
      President in 25 years.</tt></p>
      <p><tt>America�s economy is once again #1 in the world -- the
      deficit is the lowest as a share of the GDP in 22 years, the
      United States is the most competitive nation for the third
      consecutive year and America is the world�s #1 auto producer
      for the first time since 1979.</tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><tt>President Clinton�s strong economic leadership has
    helped to continue an economic expansion and create an economy
    that is the envy of the world.</tt></p>
