    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    October, 11 1996</tt>
    <center>
      <tt><b>STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ENDORSE PRESIDENT CLINTON AND
      HAIL HIS EFFORTS TO COMBAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Applauding President Clinton�s
    "fight to make America safer for our families and children," 23
    state Attorneys General endorsed the reelection of President
    Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. The Attorneys General
    explained that they "wanted everybody to know about President
    Clinton�s unprecedented efforts to end domestic
    violence."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The endorsement of the Attorneys General comes during
    Domestic Violence Awareness Month, established by the
    President, which seeks to heighten the country�s awareness of a
    national problem. President Clinton is the first president in
    history to make combating domestic violence a priority: signing
    the Violence Against Women Act, creating the Violence Against
    Women Office, establishing a national 24-hour hotline
    (1-800-799-SAFE) for victims of domestic violence, and
    increasing funding for shelters, counseling, and other efforts.
    Across the country, communities and neighborhoods today are
    recognizing the Administration�s accomplishments on domestic
    violence, and the partnership that now exists between the
    local, state, and national levels to protect women, children,
    and the elderly.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The Attorneys General hailed the President�s actions to
    bolster the ability of states to protect women and their
    families.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Frankie Sue Del Papa, Attorney General of Nevada,
    explained that the "Violence Against Women Act, included in the
    President�s Crime Bill, has already provided $126 million to
    states to strengthen local law enforcement, prosecution, and
    victims� services. No other President has done more to help
    communities protect their families."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>James Doyle, Attorney General of Wisconsin, added that
    President Clinton has fought to take guns off of our streets.
    He explained that the "Brady Bill, which President Clinton
    fought for and signed, has already prevented more than 60,000
    felons, fugitives, and stalkers from buying handguns. The
    President also fought for the Brady Bill�s expansion, so that
    it now prohibits those convicted of any offense involving
    domestic violence -- felony or misdemeanor -- from owning or
    possessing a firearm."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>While recognizing President Clinton�s accomplishments,
    many of the Attorneys General criticized Bob Dole�s lack of
    support.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Scott Harshbarger, Attorney General of Massachusetts,
    pointed out that "while President Clinton fought for the
    Violence Against Women Act, created a national 24-hour crisis
    hotline and the Violence Against Women Office in the Department
    of Justice, and proposed the toughest child support enforcement
    measures ever, Bob Dole opposed President Clinton�s efforts.
    Bob Dole voted against the President�s Crime Bill, including
    $1.6 billion in funding for the Violence Against Women Act, and
    tried to cut the Violence Against Women Act funding by almost
    43 percent."</tt></p>
