    <p><tt>For Immediate Release:<br>
    September 27, 1996</tt></p>
    <center>
      <tt><b>U.S. SCIENTISTS & ENGINEERS ENDORSE CLINTON/GORE
      TICKET</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>Former astronaut Sally Ride and 23 other distinguished
    members of the science and engineering community today
    announced the formation of “Scientists & Engineers for
    Clinton/Gore.” To coordinate this activity, the Clinton/Gore
    ’96 campaign announced the establishment of a Scientists &
    Engineers desk as part of its Office of Public
    Liaison.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Sally Ride, an Honorary Co-Chair of the group, stated,
    “The Clinton/Gore Administration has established a clear record
    of supporting research, education, and the environment while
    remaining committed to the true purpose of balancing the
    budget. These public investments in science and technology are
    central to President Clinton's visionary programs to ensure
    long-term economic growth and prosperity.”</tt></p>
    <p><tt>In contrast to President Clinton�s strong record on
    science and technology issues, Honorary Co-Chair William Julius
    Wilson, a professor of sociology at Harvard University, pointed
    out the negative effects the Dole economic plan would have on
    the future of science and technology. “The Dole economic plan
    could reduce federal non-defense R&amp;D spending by at least
    40 percent. This would devastate a national research
    infrastructure that has taken 50 years to develop and is the
    envy of the world.”</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The committee will help spotlight the dramatically
    differing views of President Clinton and Bob Dole on future
    investments in U.S. science and technology. They are sending a
    letter to prominent members of the science and engineering
    community to garner additional support for President Clinton
    and Vice President Gore. Ride explained, “Although the science
    and engineering community is not partisan in the traditional
    sense, we are determined national advocates for rational
    science and technology policies. We feel strongly that this
    leads us to support President Clinton and Vice President Gore
    in the 1996 election.”</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Spearheading Scientists & Engineers for Clinton/Gore is
    Kathleen A. Ream, Scientists & Engineers Coordinator for the
    Clinton/Gore ’96 campaign. Alan Wheat, Deputy Campaign Manager,
    said, “by establishing this desk, the campaign recognizes the
    vital contribution that scientists and engineers can make to
    the wellbeing of the country and the integral role they can
    play in the upcoming election.”</tt></p>
