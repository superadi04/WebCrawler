    <p><tt>For Immediate Release:<br>
    September 27, 1996</tt></p>

      <tt><b>CLINTON/GORE �96 APPOINTS NEW NATIONAL COORDINATOR FOR
      YOUTH OUTREACH</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>The Clinton/Gore �96 campaign has appointed Nicole Boxer
    Rodham as National Coordinator for Youth Outreach. In that
    role, Nicole will work with Youth Outreach Director Sarah
    Lichtman to ensure that the Clinton/Gore reelection campaign
    continues to reach out to young Americans and respond to the
    issues which concern young voters most.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Daughter of Senator Barbara Boxer, Nicole is a native of
    San Francisco. She graduated from New York University Film
    School in 1990 and later worked in Hollywood as a production
    company executive. She now lives in Miami with her husband Tony
    and their 15 month old son, Zachary. At the Clinton/Gore
    Campaign, Nicole will coordinate efforts to engage young adults
    in the political process. "Nicole�s energy and experience make
    her an exciting addition to the Clinton/Gore team," said Alan
    Wheat, Deputy Campaign Manager and Director of Public
    Liaison.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton has championed the issues which
    concern young voters most. He has fought for safer communities,
    a cleaner environment, and a sounder economy to provide the
    next generation with a stronger America. President Clinton has
    prepared the youth of our nation for future success by cutting
    the deficit and creating 10.5 million new jobs. He is adding
    100,000 police to our streets, and he protected 25 years of
    environmental, health, and safety protections from dangerous
    GOP cuts. In every way, President Clinton is facing tomorrow�s
    concerns today, securing a prosperous 21st Century for
    America�s young people.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"The 18-35 year old voting block does matter. When we
    have gotten involved and participated, we have made a
    difference. In 1992, our strong support propelled then-Governor
    Clinton to become President Clinton. In 1996, our continued
    support for the President will be needed to secure victory in
    November," said Nicole Boxer Rodham.<br></tt></p>
