    <p><tt>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:<br>
    September 28, 1996</tt></p>
    <center>
      <tt><b>CLINTON/GORE �96 APPOINTS NEW DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC
      LIAISON FOR NATIVE AMERICAN OUTREACH</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>The Clinton/Gore �96 campaign has appointed Julie Migiaq
    Petro as Director of Native American Outreach. She will be
    responsible for liaison with American Indians and Alaska
    Natives; coordinate Clinton/Gore �96 campaign activities for
    Native Americans; and will be instrumental in the creation of a
    honorary national steering committee of American Indians and
    Alaska Natives for Clinton/Gore �96 to be announced in
    October.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton�s record for Native Americans is
    strong. After convening the first-ever White House meeting with
    the leaders of federally recognized tribes on April 29, 1994,
    the President pledged that his Administration would work with
    tribal leaders to establish a true government-to-government
    partnership with tribal nations. He has created the Office of
    Tribal Justice and the American Indian Environmental Office,
    signed an Executive Order to protect American Indian and Alaska
    Native sacred sites, and vetoed Republican bills that would
    have drastically reduced funding for American Indian and Alaska
    Native programs.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"The Clinton Administration has built an impressive
    record on Native American issues by promoting tribal
    self-determination and education, protecting tribal natural
    resources and providing economic development opportunities,"
    said Alan Wheat, Deputy Campaign Manager and Director of Public
    Liaison. "Julie�s legislative background and work as an
    advocate of American Indians and Alaska Natives make her an
    asset to the campaign," said Wheat</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Julie Petro comes to the Clinton/Gore �96 campaign from
    the law firm of Hobbs, Straus, Dean and Walker, where she
    represented tribes and tribal organizations on legislative and
    administrative issues affecting American Indians and Alaska
    Natives. Her legislative background includes service to Alaska
    Governor Tony Knowles as Deputy Legislative Director and for
    Congressman George Miller as Legislative Staff on the House
    Committee on Natural Resources. Originally from Fairbanks,
    Alaska, she has also served as Assistant Vice President of
    NANA, an Alaska Native regional corporation, and Public Affairs
    Coordinator for the Alaska Federation of Natives.<br></tt></p>
