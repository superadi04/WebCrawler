    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    October 2, 1996</tt>
    <p><tt>TRANSCRIPT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON�S<br>
    FREE AIR TIME REMARKS ON THE FOX NETWORK</tt></p>
    <p><tt>QUESTION: What do you feel is the most critical problem
    facing our nation today?</tt></p>
    <p><tt>PRESIDENT CLINTON: America�s greatest challenge is
    giving our people the tools they need to build strong families
    and successful lives. That means a growing economy. A
    world-class education system. Safe streets. A clean
    environment.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>It also means helping parents to succeed both at home
    and at work. That�s why we passed the Family Leave law, over my
    opponent�s filibuster. Families have used it 12 million times
    now to be with a sick family member or new baby, and we�re
    working to expand it modestly to cover regular parent-teacher
    conferences and doctor visits.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>We�re fighting to fully fund Safe and Drug-Free Schools,
    and saying no to tobacco ads that target our children.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>We�re demanding more responsibility from our young
    people -- taking driver�s licenses from those who drink and
    drive, encouraging curfews and the enforcement of truancy
    laws.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Giving parents the tools to raise strong families is
    critical to building a bridge to a 21st century where our
    values are strong, and our families more secure.</tt></p>
