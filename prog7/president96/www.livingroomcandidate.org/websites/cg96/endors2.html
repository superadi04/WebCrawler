    <p><tt>PRESS RELEASE<br>
    July 26, 1996<br></tt></p>
    <center>
      <tt><b>AMERICAN INDIANS AND ALASKA NATIVE LEADERS FORM
      NATIONAL CLINTON/GORE �96 STEERING COMMITTEE</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>WASHINGTON -- Seventy American Indian and Alaska Native
    leaders from 21 states joined Peter S. Knight, Clinton/Gore �96
    Campaign Manager, and Alan Wheat, Clinton/Gore �96 Deputy
    Campaign Manager and Director of Public Liaison, via a
    nationwide teleconference call to announce the formation of an
    honorary national steering committee, "American Indian and
    Alaska Native Leaders for Clinton/Gore �96."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>With only 26 days left until election day, "American
    Indian and Alaska Native leaders for Clinton/Gore �96" pledged
    their support for President Clinton and Vice President Gore.
    They will focus on informing the American Indian and Alaska
    Native community of the Administration�s strong record in
    Indian country; promoting Get-Out-The-Vote efforts among Native
    Americans; and maximizing Native American support for the
    reelection of the President and the Vice President.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Serving as National Co-Chairs of �American Indian and
    Alaska Native Leaders for Clinton/Gore �96" are Cecil Antone,
    who is Chairman of the Inter Tribal Council of Arizona; Gregg
    Bourland, who is Chairman of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe of
    South Dakota; and Rhonda Swaney, who is Chairwoman of the
    Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribal Council in
    Montana.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"The President is proud of the support he has received
    from the American Indian and Alaska Native community. I look
    forward to their continued participation in these crucial last
    weeks before the election," said Peter S. Knight.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Alan Wheat thanked the leaders for their support and
    joined them in issuing a "Call to Action" for all Native people
    to vote. "The enthusiastic support among American Indians and
    Alaska Natives for the Clinton Administration�s policies and
    record in Indian country is an indication of the fundamental
    differences between the President�s record and the record of
    the Dole/Gingrich Congress on such basic matters as responsible
    levels of funding for Indian programs, involvement of Indian
    tribes in policy issues which affect them, and respect for
    tribal sovereignty," said Wheat.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The Committee includes tribal leaders, chairmen of
    intertribal organizations, a Native candidate running for the
    U.S. House of Representatives, Native Americans for
    Clinton/Gore �92 supporters, and heads of Alaska Native
    Corporations, Native organizations and Urban Indian
    organizations.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Attached is a list of accomplishments on American Indian
    and Alaska Native issues and a list of committee members of
    "American Indian and Alaska Native Leaders for Clinton/Gore
    �96."</tt></p>
