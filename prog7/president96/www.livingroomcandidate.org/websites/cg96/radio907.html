    <p><tt>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
    September 7, 1996</tt></p>
    <p><tt>STATEMENT BY JOE LOCKHART<br>
    NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole is having trouble with Bob Dole�s record again.
    In February, Bob Dole told New Hampshire legislators we had the
    strongest economy for thirty years. More recently, with his
    campaign struggling to find a message, Candidate Dole says we
    have no consumer confidence and the economy is in the
    tank.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole�s recent comments show how out of touch he is
    with economic reality. The economy grew at an annual rate of
    4.8 percent, unemployment is at a 7 year low, the deficit has
    come down four years in a row and 10.5 million jobs have been
    created since President Clinton took office.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>On the international front, the U.S. economy has created
    more jobs since President Clinton was elected than all the
    other G-7 countries combined. The United States now makes more
    autos than Japan, has the lowest budget deficit and has been
    judged the most competitive economy among industrialized
    countries for three years in a row. All these statistics stand
    in contrast to 1992 when the U.S. economy trailed our trading
    partners in almost every category.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The President also has a plan to balance the budget by
    2002 that has been reviewed and scored by the Congressional
    Budget Office.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole�s plan is to risk our economic future with a
    reckless scheme that will blow a hole in the deficit and result
    in severe cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the
    environment. If Bob Dole wants to be taken seriously in this
    economic debate he will submit his economic plan to the
    Congressional Budget Office for review and scoring. No more
    delays, no more hiding the facts -- the American public has a
    right to know -- submit the Dole plan to the CBO
    today.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>What we do know from Bob Dole is what�s good for
    American working families is bad for the Dole for President
    campaign.</tt></p>
