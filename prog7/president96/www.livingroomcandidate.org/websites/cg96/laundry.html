    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    October 18, 1996</tt>
    <center>
      <tt><b>STATEMENT BY JOE LOCKHART<br>
      NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>If Bob Dole wants to talk about campaign money
    laundering, he should check in with his own campaign
    fundraisers. Currently, there are three ongoing federal
    investigations of fund raising practices within the Dole for
    President campaign.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Simon Fireman, a Dole for President Finance Vice-Chair,
    has already agreed to pay a $6 million fine for illegal
    "laundering" of funds through a Hong Kong bank into the Dole
    campaign. Mr. Fireman faces a sentencing hearing next week to
    determine the length of his prison term. Similar cases are
    being investigated involving the Dole campaign in Pennsylvania
    and Nevada.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole raised important campaign finance issues today.
    But when it comes to illegal campaign contributions, the Dole
    for President campaign, using Bob Dole�s own words, is a full
    service laundromat.</tt></p>

    <p><tt><b>The Dole Campaign�s Money Laundering</b></tt></p>
    <p><tt><u>July 1996:<br>
    Dole Finance Vice-Chair Fireman Plead Guilty To U.S. Attorney
    For Illegal Campaign Contributions.</u> Earlier this year, Dole
    Finance Vice Chairman Simon Fireman was caught illegally
    reimbursing his Aqua-Leisure employees for $69,000 in
    contributions -- run through a bank in Hong Kong -- to Dole�s
    1996 Presidential campaign. Fireman has agreed to plead guilty
    to this crime and has agreed to a Government-recommended
    sentence of six months in prison, a $1 million fine for himself
    and a $5 million fine for his company as part of a plea bargain
    with the U.S. Attorney. [New York Times, 7/11/96; K.C. Star,
    7/11/96; 7/23/96; 9/29/96; Boston Globe, 7/22/96]</tt></p>
    <p><tt><u>April 1996:<br>
    Federal Law Enforcement Agents Are Currently Investigating
    Empire Landfill�s Questionable $50,000 Contribution Scheme.</u>
    Federal agents are currently examining nearly $50,000 in
    contributions to Dole�s 1996 Presidential campaign by employees
    of Pennsylvania-based waste disposal company -- Empire
    Landfill. The contributions are suspicious because many came
    from lower-level employees who donated large amounts of money
    on the same day. [Wall Street Journal, 5/8/96; Washington Post,
    4/25/96]</tt></p>
    <p><tt><u>September 1996:<br>
    Illegal Scheme By Nevada Liquor Company To Funnel Money To Dole
    Is Uncovered.</u> Just over two weeks ago, it was reported that
    DeLuca Liquor & Wine of Nevada gave thousands of dollars to its
    managers and then asked them to make individual contributions
    to Dole�s Presidential campaign. The company admitted the
    scheme and a DeLuca VP said, "It's not illegal, I hope." On a
    single day in 1995, Dole�s campaign collected at least $10,000
    from DeLuca executives and their wives. GOP Representative John
    Ensign of Nevada has said that the Federal Election Commission
    should investigate this situation. [K.C. Star, 9/29/96;
    10/4/96]</tt></p>
