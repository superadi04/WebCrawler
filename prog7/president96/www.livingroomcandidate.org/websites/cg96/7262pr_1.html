    7/26/96<br>
    PRESS RELEASE<br></tt>
    <p><tt>CLINTON/GORE '96 APPOINTS DISABILITY OUTREACH
    DIRECTOR</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"Three and a half years ago, when I took the oath of
    office, I had a very clear vision of what I hoped our country
    could be like as we move into the 21st century. In 1992, I
    issued a challenge to our nation. I said we must not rest until
    America has a national disability policy based on three simple
    creeds: inclusion, not exclusion; independence, not dependence;
    and empowerment, not paternalism. I remain committed to that
    vision." President William J. Clinton, May 23, 1996.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Keeping with the President's vision and commitment,
    Becky Ogle has been named Disability Desk Director of the
    Office of Public Liaison, Clinton/Gore'96 Campaign headquarters
    in Washington, D.C.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Ms. Ogle, a well-known disability rights activist and
    leader, is Chair of Justice For All, a national grassroots
    organization that defends and advances disability rights. As
    Director of Disability Outreach for Clinton/Gore'96, Ms. Ogle
    will ensure that people with disabilities and the disability
    rights agenda are integrated into every aspect of the
    Clinton/Gore'96 re-election effort.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Overall, people with disabilities are the largest
    minority in America--49 million persons, of whom more than 35
    million are of voting age. According to a recent nationwide
    Harris Poll, President Clinton enjoys a 31 percentage point
    lead over Senator Bob Dole among adults with disabilities. "The
    disability vote can have a significant impact on the nation's
    leadership," said Alan Reich, President of the National
    Organization on Disability upon releasing the
    findings.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>In the 1992 Presidential election, Bill Clinton won the
    disability vote overwhelmingly against President Bush by 50
    percent to 26 percent with 18 per cent voting for
    Perot.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"The disability community is important to President
    Clinton's re-election effort," stated, Alan Wheat, Deputy
    Campaign Manager for Public Liaison. Wheat continued,
    "President Clinton has demonstrated his allegiance to
    disability rights since he assumed his presidency. Throughout
    the Clinton administration individuals with disabilities have
    been appointed to positions of authority and power contributing
    a significant portion to policy issues across the board.
    President Clinton has fought to make sure that people with
    disabilities have health care and the living wages they need to
    live independently."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton stated recently to a conference in
    Detroit, Michigan, "We must preserve the guarantee of Medicaid
    coverage for people with disabilities. Last year Congress sent
    me legislation to repeal that guarantee -- legislation that
    would have taken away health care coverage from millions of
    Americans who need it most. I vetoed that legislation, and if
    they send it to me again and they want to repeal the guarantee,
    I will veto it again."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"While the Harris poll numbers look good, we do not
    assume that we can take the disability vote for granted," said
    Wheat, and he concluded, "The disability community will be
    visible throughout our re-election effort and we take their
    vote very seriously."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Prior to Ms. Ogle's role as Chair of Justice For All,
    she served as Director of Project Access Ability for the
    National Association of Medical Equipment Services in
    Alexandria, VA. Ms. Ogle is a person with spina bifida and uses
    a wheelchair.</tt></p>
