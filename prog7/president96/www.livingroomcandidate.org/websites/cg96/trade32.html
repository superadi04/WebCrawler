              Oregon is the country�s 25th largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $571 million in
              agricultural exports abroad or 1.3% of the U.S. total
              in 1994 (latest year available for Department of
              Agriculture state export data). The largest export
              categories, wheat and vegetables, accounted for over
              half of Oregon�s agricultural exports in 1994. Given
              the 22 percent increase in total U.S. agriculture
              exports in 1995, agriculture exports from Oregon in
              1995 will likely range between $650 million and $750
              million.
