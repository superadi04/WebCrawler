              Illinois is the country�s second largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $3.1 billion in
              agricultural exports abroad or 7.0% of the U.S. total
              in 1994 (latest year available for Department of
              Agriculture state export data). The largest export
              categories, feed grains and soybeans, accounted for
              over 75 percent of Illinois� agricultural exports in
              1994. Given the 22 percent increase in total U.S.
              agriculture exports in 1995, agriculture exports from
              Illinois in 1995 will likely range between $3.6
              billion and $3.8 billion.
