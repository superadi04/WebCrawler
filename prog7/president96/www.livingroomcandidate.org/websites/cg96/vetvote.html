    <p><tt>PRESS RELEASE<br>
    October 30, 1996</tt></p>
    <center>
      <tt><b>VETERANS FACE IMPORTANT CHOICE ON ELECTION
      DAY</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- On election day, November 5,
    veterans and their families will play a key role in deciding
    the course of America�s future. Their choice is clear.
    President Clinton has a proven record of accomplishments for
    veterans. American veterans have better VA health care, more
    jobs and opportunities, and stronger communities than four
    years ago.</tt></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt><b>President Clinton</b> expanded veterans� benefits.
      President Clinton expanded disability compensation for
      Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange and their children
      and for Persian Gulf veterans with undiagnosed illnesses. He
      fought for full cost-of-living adjustments on benefits for
      disabled veterans and military retirees. In contrast, in 1995
      Dole voted to eliminate compensation for certain incompetent
      service-disabled veterans, to cut veterans� medical care by
      $511 million, and to kill two new VA hospitals.</tt></p>
      <p><tt><b>President Clinton</b> re-vamped VA health care and
      protected it from Republican budget cuts. As part of his
      Reinventing Government initiative,</tt></p>
      <p><tt><b>President Clinton</b> reformed VA health care,
      cutting red tape and improving patient care. He also fought
      for $1 billion more in fiscal 1996 to care for more veterans
      and build new hospitals.</tt></p>
      <p><tt><b>President Clinton</b> promoted economic
      opportunities for veterans. Under President Clinton�s
      leadership, the federal government has increased the
      percentage of new federal jobs filled by veterans by 10
      points and helped over 1.5 million veterans find civilian
      jobs. The unemployment rate among veterans has dropped by
      more than one-third.</tt></p>
      <p><tt><b>President Clinton</b> expanded America�s economy.
      In 1993, without a single Republican vote, President Clinton
      pushed through his deficit reduction package. Since then,
      more than 10.5 million new jobs have been created; the
      deficit has been cut by 63%; the average household income has
      increased by $1,600; and household income inequality fell
      more in 1995 than in any year since 1968.</tt></p>
      <p><tt><b>President Clinton</b> strengthened our communities.
      President Clinton is making our streets safer by adding
      100,000 new cops on the beat, taking guns away from criminals
      through the Brady Bill, and banning 19 types of assault
      weapons. His approach is working: the violent crime rate has
      fallen four straight years.</tt></p>
    </blockquote><tt>"For veterans, the choice is clear: President
    Clinton is on their side," said</tt>
    <p><tt>Tom Keefe, Director of Veterans Outreach. "His sterling
    record on bread-and-butter veterans� issues explains why he was
    endorsed by veterans nationwide, including Medal of Honor
    recipients, past national commanders of major veterans
    organizations, and other prominent veterans including Jesse
    Brown, who is the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Hershel Gober,
    who is the Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Lieutenant
    General (ret) Thomas Kelly, and Admiral (ret) Elmo
    Zumwalt."</tt></p>
