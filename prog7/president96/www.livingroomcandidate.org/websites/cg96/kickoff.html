      <tt><b>CLINTON/GORE �96 KICKS-OFF<br>
      ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN NATIONAL GOVERNING COUNCIL</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>The Clinton/Gore campaign today announced the formation
    of the "Asian Pacific American National Governing Council." The
    Council consists of Asian Pacific American community leaders
    and activists from various states around the nation.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The Honorary Co-Chairs for the National Governing
    Council include: Benjamin Cayetano, who is Governor of Hawaii;
    Daniel Inouye and Daniel Akaka, the two U.S. Senators from
    Hawaii; Bob Matsui, who is a U.S. Congressman from California;
    Patsy Mink, who is a U.S. Congresswoman from Hawaii; Robert
    Underwood, who is U.S. Delegate from Guam; Eni Faleomavaega,
    who is U.S. Delegate from American Samoa; Mazie Hirono, who is
    Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii; and Gary Locke, who is Chief
    Executive for King County, Washington, and Honorary Chair of
    the Clinton/Gore �96 campaign.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>To kick off "Clinton/Gore �96 Asian Pacific American
    National Governing Council," Asian Pacific American leaders
    held press conferences in Los Angeles and San Francisco,
    California to show their support for President Bill Clinton and
    Vice President Al Gore.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The creation of the "Asian Pacific American National
    Governing Council," reflects the continuing success of the
    President�s initiatives in delivering better living standards
    to millions of Asian Pacific Americans. The President�s
    economic agenda has created over 10.5 million jobs, a record
    number of new business start-ups, and the launching of
    Citizenship USA, which is helping thousands of Asian Pacific
    Americans be full participants in America�s democratic
    process.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"The President is proud of the support he has received
    from the Asian Pacific American community. The Asian Pacific
    community is a crucial part of this campaign," Clinton/Gore �96
    Campaign Manager Peter S. Knight said today. "I look forward to
    the community�s continued participation in these crucial last
    weeks before the election."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The Clinton/Gore �96 "Asian Pacific American National
    Governing Council" will mobilize a number of Asian Pacific
    leaders who will work in their communities to educate and turn
    out Asian Pacific American voters across the country in support
    of the reelection of President Clinton and Vice President
    Gore.<br></tt></p>
