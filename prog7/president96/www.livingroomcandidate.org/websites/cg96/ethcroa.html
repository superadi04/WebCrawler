      <tt><b>CROATIAN AMERICAN LEADERS FORM<br>
      CLINTON/GORE �96 NATIONAL STEERING COMMITTEE</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>Washington, D.C. -- The Clinton/Gore campaign today
    announced the formation of the "Croatian Americans for
    Clinton/Gore Honorary National Steering Committee."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The Honorary co-chairs of the �Croatian Americans for
    Clinton/ Gore �96 National Steering Committee� are Dennis
    Kucinich, who is a State Senator and U.S. Congressional
    candidate from Ohio; Tom Rukavina, who is a State
    Representative from Minnesota; and Bernard Luketich, who is
    Mayor of Cokeburg, PA. The Steering Committee will be led by
    co-chairs Mark Sostarich, who is State Chair of the Wisconsin
    Democratic Party; Mijo Radocaj, who is President of Jacodar,
    Inc. in Ohio; and Steve Rukavina, who is President of the
    National Federation of Croatian Americans.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Kucinich said, "I believe President Clinton has earned
    the support of many Croatian Americans because of all his
    efforts to strengthen the American economy and enhance
    educational opportunities for all Americans. As a Member of
    Congress, I will fully support the President�s innovative
    leadership to protect American families and ensure peace and
    stability around the world."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Members of the national steering committee are
    distinguished Croatian American leaders from Ohio, Illinois,
    Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, New York and
    Pennsylvania. These steering committee members are all involved
    in efforts to increase voter support for the President. The
    "Croatian Americans for Clinton/Gore �96" will focus on the
    following activities:</tt></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>Informing the Croatian American community of the
      President�s accomplishments;<br>
      Identifying voters in the community; and<br>
      Rallying Croatian Americans behind the reelection of the
      President.</tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><tt>"The Croatian American heritage of faith in God, love of
    family, respect for hard work and education exemplifies
    enduring American values that will continue to help President
    Clinton build a bridge to the 21st Century," said Ilir Zherka,
    Clinton/Gore Ethnic Outreach Director. "I believe that the key
    support from these Croatian American leaders demonstrates their
    appreciation for President Clinton�s efforts to help Croatia
    build its democracy and safeguard its borders. I am convinced
    that with the help of this steering committee the Clinton/Gore
    campaign will earn many votes from Croatian Americans all
    across the country on November 5th."</tt></p>
