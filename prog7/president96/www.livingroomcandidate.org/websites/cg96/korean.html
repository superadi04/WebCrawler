  </center>
  <p>New York -- Tri-State area Korean Americans announced the
  formation of "Korean Americans for Clinton/Gore�96," a new
  national group in support of the reelection of President Bill
  Clinton and Vice President Al Gore in New York. The announcement
  was made on August 1, 1996 at the Macedonia Church in Flushing,
  New York with approximately 200 key Korean American supporters in
  attendance.</p>
  <p>Special guest speakers included Sharon Singh, Assistant
  Director of Public Liaison for Asian Pacific American Outreach,
  Clinton/Gore�96; and Il-Pyong Kim, Professor of Political Science
  at the University of Connecticut.</p>
  <p>"President Clinton is very much aware of the contributions
  that Korean Americans have made to society. His commitment to
  diversity and equality is evident in his Administration and
  policies," said Dr. Kim, who addressed the audience in the Korean
  language. Dr. Kim�s remarks centered on why Korean Americans need
  to support President Clinton in the upcoming election.</p>
  <p>President Clinton and Vice President Gore have taken the lead
  on issues important to many of the ethnic communities including
  the Korean American community. Some of these accomplishments
  include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Increasing access to college by reforming student loans and
    expanding work study;</li>
    <li>Expanding trade markets in Asia and the Pacific for U.S.
    exports;</li>
    <li>Appointing 195 political appointees to this
    Administration;</li>
    <li>Signing the Family and Medical Leave Act so workers can
    take time off to care for a sick family member without losing
    their jobs;</li>
    <li>Establishing Americorps so young people now have the
    opportunity to serve their communities while earning money for
    college.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Also attending was David K. Chai, Assistant to the Deputy
  Campaign Manager and Chief Operating Officer for Clinton/Gore�96;
  and APA Steering Committee members Seung Hong, Daok Lee, Jae
  Sung, and John Kim.</p>
  <p>"The Korean American community is an integral part of the
  Asian Pacific American community. Their support for
  Clinton/Gore�96 is vital to the success of this national
  election. Korean Americans for Clinton/Gore�96 is open to all
  individuals regardless of party affiliation. The time has come
  for all Korean Americans to fully participate in the American
  electoral process," said Singh.</p>
