    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    September 30, 1996</tt>
    <p><tt>CLINTON/GORE �96 ANNOUNCES INNOVATIONS TO
    WEB-SITE</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton�s and Vice President Gore�s
    re-election campaign is breaking new ground on the information
    superhighway. Clinton/Gore �96 is relaunching its world wide
    web site to showcase state of the art technological advances,
    announced Clinton/Gore �96 Campaign Manager Peter S. Knight.
    All of the groundbreaking changes can be found on the internet
    at</tt></p>

      <tt><b>http://www.cg96.org</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>President Clinton and Vice President Gore understand
    that continuing investments in technology represent an
    investment in our nation�s future. Technology opens doors,
    creates jobs, and makes possible the opportunity for all of our
    citizens to reach out for the American dream. "We are excited
    about these additions and innovations on our web site. Through
    these interactive components, our web site users can be a part
    of our campaign and see first hand how the campaigns are
    strategizing to win the electoral college on November 5th,"
    said Knight.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>One of the most exciting changes in the website is a new
    main menu which features a "java script mouse-over
    application." Animated icons appear as the mouse rolls over the
    headings for each section offering the viewer a "sneak peak" of
    each section of the site. "We have not found any other site
    that has implemented this unique viewing option," stated
    Clinton/Gore �96 Director of Technology Adam Sohn.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Another new, interactive aspect of the web site is an
    electoral college simulation game. The simlulator allows users
    to learn about the state-by-state electoral voting system in a
    fun, easy to use interactive, map-driven game. As users choose
    states for each candidate, the electoral process is revealed
    and a presidential candidate becomes the winner.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The web site also includes a new multimedia presentation
    entitled, "The Challenges Ahead" to keep web browsers informed
    about the issues important to them. This visually stimulating
    presentation features streaming audio and still photographs,
    and will be continually updated with short segments of
    President Clinton�s vision for the challenges that face our
    nation.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton�s trademark of listening to
    communities and appealing to people all across America to
    become involved has been incorporated into the web site in a
    new feature called, "America�s Home Page." Each week,
    Clinton/Gore �96 web site users submit testimonials and stories
    on why they support the Clinton/Gore ticket. These are made
    available to read each week in the "America�s Home Page"
    newsletter. It is an opportunity for web users to share how
    they have been affected by President Clinton and the work of
    this Administration and another example of the Clinton/Gore �96
    campaign�s commitment to community involvement.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>With all these new services available, Clinton/Gore �96
    has added a new technology which allows users to select
    specific content from the web site and register to have it
    automatically updated whenever they are on the web. Every time
    a user logs back into the Internet, the server automatically
    begins downloading the updated information from the
    Clinton/Gore �96 page in the background. The viewer is alerted
    when it is done. This exciting technology will keep
    Clinton/Gore �96 web site users updated on information
    including the President�s campaign speeches and additions to
    the "Challenges Ahead" video.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The web site will continue to provide instant access to
    statements by the President, position papers, and detailed
    accounts of the Clinton Administration�s record. Those who want
    to get involved can register to volunteer, while journalists
    will also gain access to valuable information quickly and
    easily.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Finally, no campaign is complete without bumper stickers
    and buttons. The Clinton/Gore �96 web site has available bumper
    stickers and buttons in addition to screen savers and
    wallpaper.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>For the next five weeks this virtual campaign
    headquarters will take the President�s vision for the next four
    years and his proud record of achievement directly to America�s
    voters.</tt></p>
