    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    October 31, 1996</tt>
    <center>
      <tt><b>FORMER NEW YORK CITY POLICE COMMISSIONER WILLIAM J.
      BRATTON ENDORSES PRESIDENT CLINTON AND VICE PRESIDENT
      GORE</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Former New York City Police
    Commissioner William J. Bratton, one of the nation�s preeminent
    and most effective police managers, will personally endorse the
    re-election of President Clinton and Vice President Gore today.
    Bratton will join the President at Arizona State University in
    Phoenix today to present his endorsement.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bratton is a national leader in community policing and
    in successfully applying executive management to crime
    prevention. Under Bratton�s leadership, crime in New York
    dropped to its lowest level in all categories in 25 years.
    Violent crime decreased by over 38 percent and murders dropped
    a remarkable 51 percent in New York City during Bratton�s
    tenure. He was Police Commissioner of the City of New York from
    January 1994 to April 1996.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bratton credits President Clinton�s crime policies as a
    key factor in his success. "When it came to passing the Crime
    Bill, President Clinton delivered. His crime bill is putting
    100,000 police on the streets of America and we are now seeing
    its success. Crime is going down across America and is a result
    of Bill Clinton�s effort," Bratton said. Bratton has noted that
    funding and other provisions in that legislation greatly
    assisted New York City in reducing crime.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>When Bratton became police commissioner, he announced
    that he would be "taking the City back from criminals one
    block, one street, and one neighborhood at a time." The results
    speak for themselves. As one New York City beat cop remarked,
    "This is a guy who is ending urban crime as we know
    it."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bratton is currently President of First Security
    Consulting and is working with police departments throughout
    the United States and abroad to implement the crime reduction
    strategies that were so successful in New York City.</tt></p>
