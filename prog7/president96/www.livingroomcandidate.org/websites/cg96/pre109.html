      <tt><b>Prebuttal: Kemp vs. the Facts<br>
      October 9, 1996</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>Jack Kemp plays with boundless enthusiasm, but the
    question for tonight�s debate will be whether he strays out of
    bounds or stays on the field of facts. Watch out for some of
    these errant throws:</tt></p>
    <center>
      <tt><b>1993 CLINTON-GORE ECONOMIC PROGRAM</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt><b>Rhetoric</b>: The Clinton plan "does not create jobs,
    at least in the private sector. It�s going to create a lot of
    jobs in the public sector and in the bureaucracy." [Meet the
    Press, 3/7/93]</tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>Reality</b>: Not true. Under Clinton-Gore, the
    economy has added 10.5 million new jobs -- a faster rate of job
    growth than any Republican Administration since the 1920s.
    [Data from Bureau of Labor Statistics, 10/4/96] Of these 10.5
    million jobs, 93 percent are in the private-sector -- a higher
    private sector share than any Administration since Harry S
    Truman. [Data from the BLS, 10/4/96] The conservative business
    magazine Barron�s -- and Bob Dole himself last February --
    called the economy the best in over 30 years. [Barron�s
    3/18/96; Dole remarks in NH, 2/13/96, Release by Dole Campaign,
    2/20/96]</tt></p>
    <center>
      <tt><b>LARGEST TAX INCREASE</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt><b>Rhetoric</b>: "[Democrats] raised taxes -- the
    biggest, I guess, of this century." [Washington Post,
    9/2/96]</tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>Reality</b>: Kemp�s position was different before he
    was Bob Dole�s running mate. In 1994, Jack Kemp�s Empower
    America said Dole�s 1982 hike was "the largest tax increase in
    recent years." [Empower America Reality Check, 2/24/94] In
    1988, Kemp said Dole�s increase amounted to "$1600 for every
    man, woman and child." [St. Petersburg Times, 2/11/88] Every
    serious observer agrees that Bob Dole�s 1982 tax increase is
    the largest in history. New York Times, 11/3/95: "It is not
    true that the $240 billion tax increase approved by Congress in
    1993 at Mr. Clinton's behest is the largest in American
    history. When adjusted for inflation...a tax increase
    engineered by Mr. Dole in 1982, when he was the chairman of
    Senate Finance Committee, was larger."</tt></p>
    <center>
      <tt><b>KEMP-ROTH</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt><b>Rhetoric</b>: After the Kemp-Roth tax cuts "the
    revenues coming into the government by lowering the tax rates
    by 25 percent, actually -- revenues grew by 40 percent." [ Sec.
    Kemp on Meet the Press, 10/6/96]</tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>Reality</b>: Contrary to this supply-side myth, after
    Reagan's 1981 tax cut, real personal income tax revenues fell
    for three consecutive years. They did not recover to their 1981
    level until 1986, even though the economy was in recovery.
    [Dept. of the Treasury] This loss of income tax revenue helped
    explode the deficit. The only revenues that went up were from
    Social Security taxes, owing to increases in the payroll tax
    rates in 1981, 1982, 1984, 1985 and 1986. [Dept. of the
    Treasury] From 1980 to 1986 -- when the Republicans controlled
    the White House and the Senate -- the deficit nearly tripled,
    increasing from $74 billion in FY80 to $221 billion in FY86.
    [CBO, 5/96]</tt></p>

      <tt><b>WAGES AND INCOMES</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt><b>Rhetoric</b>: "The income of working men and women in
    America is dropping or stagnant." [Kemp Acceptance Speech,
    8/15/96]</tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>Reality</b>: Real median household income increased
    more in 1995 than in any year in a decade, and the typical
    family�s income, adjusted for inflation, has increased by
    $1,631 since 1993. [Census Bureau, 9/26/96] After falling by 79
    cents during the Reagan-Bush years, "real wages are rising for
    the first time in a decade." [Based on data from BLS, 10/4/96;
    Business Week, 3/11/96]</tt></p>
    <center>
      <tt><b>MEDICARE</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt><b>Rhetoric</b>: "Bob Dole and I are going to save and
    strengthen Medicare. The Democratic Party has [been]...scaring
    the elderly into thinking otherwise..." [Jack Kemp, AP,
    10/02/96]</tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>Reality</b>: Bob Dole reaffirmed his vote against
    Medicare just last year. "I was there, fighting the fight,
    voting against Medicare -- one of 12 -- because we knew it
    wouldn�t work in 1965." [Dole Speech to the American
    Conservative Union 10/24/95]. In 1995, Dole-Gingrich tried to
    cut Medicare by $270 billion -- increasing premiums by $1700
    per couple over 7 years. The experts agree -- 83% of economists
    surveyed by the Economist said Dole would have to cut Medicare
    to balance the budget and enact his risky tax scheme.
    [Economist, October 5, 1996] His own Campaign Co-Chair, Senator
    Al D�Amato, was more candid than Senator Dole: "You�re gonna
    have to look at Medicare...I mean, I�m not running this year,
    so I can say it and tell the truth." [Don Imus Show,
    8/12/96]</tt></p>
    <center>
      <tt><b>REGULATION</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt><b>Rhetoric</b>: "[The economy is] moving like a ship
    dragging an anchor, the anchor of taxes, and excessive
    regulations..." [Kemp Acceptance Speech, 8/15/96]</tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>Reality</b>: From 1986 to 1993, the volume of federal
    regulations grew by 10,000 pages [Office of Information and
    Regulatory Affairs, 10/96] The Clinton-Gore Administration is
    cutting them by 16,000 pages. Under the Vice President�s
    National Performance Review, the growth in new regulations that
    took place when Sec. Kemp was running HUD has been reversed.
    The Small Business Administration has cut its loan application
    form from one inch to one page. [NPR Report, 9/96] And HUD has
    eliminated 1,782 pages of regulations that it inherited from
    Secretary Kemp. [OIRA, 8/31/96]</tt></p>
    <center>
      <tt><b>BUDGET/SPENDING CUTS</b></tt>
    </center><tt>Rhetoric: "Balancing the budget while cutting
    taxes is just a matter of presidential will." [Kemp Acceptance
    Speech, 8/15/96]</tt>
    <p><tt><b>Reality</b>: What Bob Dole used to say about the
    deficit: "You can�t just wish it away. We can�t just say,
    �Well, we�re just going to cut taxes� -- that�s called supply
    side, as I recall it -- if you just cut taxes enough, the
    deficit�s going to go away. Baloney." [Natl. Fed. of GOP Women
    Speech, 5/21/91] 546 economists and 7 Nobel Prize winners say
    the Dole plan will "raise the federal deficit" and lead to the
    "lowering of future living standards." [EPI sponsored letter,
    9/4/96] Time magazine said: "[A]nalysts say agencies from the
    FBI to the Transportation Department could face cuts as deep as
    40%." [9/23/96] Of course, balancing the budget never mattered
    much to Jack Kemp: "[T]he most important thing with all due
    respect, is not balancing the budget." [NBC Today Show,
    8/5/96]</tt></p>
