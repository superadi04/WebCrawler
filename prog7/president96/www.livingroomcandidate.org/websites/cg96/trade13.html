              Tennessee is the country�s 28th largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $403 million in
              agricultural exports abroad in 1994 (latest year
              available for Department of Agriculture state export
              data). The largest export categories, soybeans,
              tobacco, and cotton and linters, accounted for over
              65 percent of Tennessee�s agricultural exports in
              1994. Given the 22 percent increase in total U.S.
              agriculture exports in 1995, agriculture exports from
              Tennessee in 1995 will likely range between $450
              million and $500 million.
