    <p><tt>6/25/96<br>
    PRESS RELEASE<br></tt></p>
    <p><tt>STATEMENT BY ANN LEWIS<br>
    DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton welcomes the endorsement of jazz
    legend Lionel Hampton. Mr. Hampton has been a loyal Republican
    for over fifty years. In fact, the last Democrat Mr. Hampton
    supported was President Harry S. Truman.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Mr. Hampton, in a statement that he gave to the
    President in New York last night, said the following:</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"I originally joined the Republican party because it was
    the party of Abraham Lincoln. Over the years I became
    personally friendly with and supported Dwight Eisenhower,
    Ronald Reagan, Prescott and George Bush, as well as John
    Lindsay, Nelson Rockefeller and many others who are still
    friends. But it seems the Republican party of today doesn't
    recognize the views of moderate Republicans like me."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton and Vice President Gore appreciate the
    support of Mr. Hampton.</tt></p>
