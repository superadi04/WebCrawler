            <blockquote>
              Tipper Gore is the wife of Al Gore, the Vice
              President of the United States. Mrs. Gore is well
              known for her efforts to support children, understand
              mental health, and combat homelessness.
              <p>Mrs. Gore is President Clinton’s Mental Health
              Advisor. She is committed to eradicating the stigmas
              associated with mental health problems and substance
              abuse; she also seeks to ensure high-quality,
              affordable mental health care.</p>
              <p>Mrs. Gore founded Tennessee Voices for Children to
              support young people with serious behavioral,
              emotional, substance abuse, or other mental health
              problems. She co-founded and chaired Families for the
              Homeless, a non-profit organization that raises
              public awareness of homelessness, and produced a
              major photographic exhibit,&nbsp;“Homeless in
              America: A Photographic Project,” in conjunction with
              the National Mental Health Association (NMHA).</p>
              <p>To draw attention to the violence that children
              are exposed to through the media, Mrs. Gore helped
              form the Congressional Wives Task Force. She later
              founded an organization that encouraged the voluntary
              labeling of explicit music lyrics and wrote a book
              about parenting and the media.</p>
              <p>Born Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson on August 19, 1948,
              Mrs. Gore grew up in Arlington, Virginia. She was
              nicknamed Tipper by her mother. In 1970 she married
              Al Gore. They have four children: Karenna, Kristin,
              Sarah, and Albert III.</p>
              <p>Mrs. Gore received her Bachelor’s degree in
              Psychology from Boston University in 1970 and her
              Master’s degree in Psychology from George Peabody
              College in 1975. Mrs. Gore worked as a photographer
              for the Nashville <i>Tennessean</i> until Vice
              President Gore was elected to Congress in 1976.</p>
              <p>A strong proponent of regular exercise, Mrs. Gore
              jogs, bikes, and enjoys rollerblading with her
              children.</p>
