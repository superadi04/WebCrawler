    is a cornerstone of President Clinton and Vice President Gore's
    economic and national security strategy. The Administration is
    working to strengthen America's scientific and technological
    lead by promoting U.S. competitiveness, by creating high-wage
    jobs, by maintaining America's military superiority, by
    improving education and health care, and by protecting the
    environment.
