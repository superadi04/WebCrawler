      <p><tt><b>STATEMENT BY JOE LOCKHART<br>
      NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY</b></tt></p>
    </center>
    <p><tt>We agree that campaign finance reform is long overdue
    and should be dealt with in a bipartisan fashion. But it�s a
    little late -- and disingenuous -- for Bob Dole to promote
    campaign finance reform. Bob Dole has made a career opposing
    meaningful campaign finance reform, including actively blocking
    the McCain/Feingold proposal which President Clinton
    supported.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>It�s too bad that Senator Bob Dole�s record doesn�t
    match Candidate Dole�s rhetoric.</tt></p>

    <p><tt><b>Bob Dole�s History Of Campaign Finance Ethical
    Lapses</b></tt></p>
    <p><tt>"<i>Dole has another embarrassment on his hands about
    how his campaign raises money. When it happens time and time
    again, and it�s the same (alleged) violation, it's very
    serious. You have what I would call election-law recidivism."
    -- Charles Lewis, head of the Center for Public Integrity [K.C.
    Star, 9/29/96]</i></tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>September 1996:<br>
    Illegal Scheme By Nevada Liquor Company To Funnel Money To Dole
    Is Uncovered.</b> In September 1996, it was reported that
    DeLuca Liquor & Wine of Nevada gave thousands of dollars to its
    managers and then asked them to make individual contributions
    to Dole�s Presidential campaign. The company admitted the
    scheme and a DeLuca VP said, "It's not illegal, I hope." On a
    single day in 1995, Dole�s campaign collected at least $10,000
    from DeLuca executives and their wives. [K.C. Star,
    9/29/96]</tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>April 1996:<br>
    Empire Landfill�s Questionable $50,000 Contribution Scheme To
    Dole Is Discovered.</b> Federal agents are currently examining
    nearly $50,000 in contributions to Dole�s 1996 Presidential
    campaign by employees of Pennsylvania-based waste disposal
    company -- Empire Landfill. The contributions are suspicious
    because many came from lower-level employees on the same day.

    <p><tt><b>April 1996:<br>
    Aqua-Leisure�s $69,000 Illegal Contribution Scheme To Dole Is
    Uncovered.</b> Earlier this year, Simon Fireman agreed to pay a
    $6 million fine as part of a plea bargain with the U.S.
    Attorney for illegally reimbursing his Aqua-Leisure employees
    for $69,000 in contributions to Dole�s 1996 Presidential
    campaign. [K.C. Star, 7/11/96; 7/23/96; 9/29/96; Boston Globe,
    7/22/96]</tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>Dole�s 1986 Senate Campaign (September 1995):<br>
    FEC Rules Dole�s 1986 Senate Campaign Accepted Illegal Birdview
    Contributions.</b> In September 1995, the FEC fined officials
    of Kansas-based Birdview Satellite Communications for illegally
    taking company money in return for personal contributions to
    Dole�s 1986 Senate campaign. The FEC found that Birdview
    employees were encouraged to give to Dole and were repaid by
    the company. [K.C. Star, 9/18/95]</tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>June 1995:<br>
    Dole Forced To Close "Better America Foundation"After Using It
    To Circumvent Law.</b>In June 1995, political pressure forced
    Dole to close his "Better America Foundation" and reveal its
    donors. The foundation had allowed large companies and wealthy
    individuals to bypass campaign finance laws and give $4.6
    million to Dole. Unlike campaigns, this tax-exempt foundation
    was not required to disclose donors and had no contribution
    limits. Dole was using the then-secret funds for polling and a
    commercial featuring Dole. [Washington Post, 6/21/95]</tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>Dole�s 1988 Presidential Campaign (August 1993):<br>
    Dole�s 1988 Campaign Received Largest FEC Fine In History For
    Improper Activities.</b>In 1993, Dole�s 1988 Presidential
    campaign paid a then-record $100,000 civil fine to the FEC for
    campaign violations, including: exceeding primary campaign
    spending limits in Iowa and New Hampshire by $588,149,
    knowingly accepting $64,043 in illegal corporate contributions
    and improperly accepting $239,131 in over-contributions. [K.C.
    Star, 8/7/93] </tt></p>
    <p><tt><b>September 1976:<br>
    Gulf Oil Lobbyist Said That He Gave Illegal Corporate
    Contribution To Dole In 1973.</b> In September 1976, it was
    reported that Gulf Oil�s top lobbyist told a Federal grand jury
    that in 1973 he made an illegal corporate contribution of
    $5,000 or $6,000 from Gulf�s secret slush fund to Dole. The
    lobbyist also said that he gave Dole $2,000 in 1970 to pass on
    to other candidates. The lobbyist later flip-flopped on the
    second assertion but in 1970, he had written on the check stub,
    "given to Dole for disbursement by him." As part of the
    investigation into this matter, Dole testified before a Federal
    grand jury. [New York Times, 9/6/76; 9/7/96; 9/8/96;
