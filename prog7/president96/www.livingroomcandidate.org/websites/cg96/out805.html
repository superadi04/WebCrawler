    <p><tt>PRESS RELEASE<br>
    August 5, 1996</tt></p>
    <p><tt>CLINTON/GORE '96 APPOINTS NEW ASSISTANT DIRECTOR<br>
    OF PUBLIC LIASON FOR ETHNIC OUTREACH</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The Clinton/Gore �96 campaign has appointed Ilir Zherka
    to be Assistant Director of Public Liaison for Ethnic Outreach.
    Mr. Zherka will be responsible for creating national and state
    ethnic steering committees; communicating the accomplishments
    of the Clinton Administration to ethnic communities nationwide;
    and energizing ethnic Americans to support the reelection of
    President Clinton and Vice President Gore.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Since coming into office, President Clinton has
    accumulated an impressive record on issues of concern to ethnic
    Americans. The President has provided leadership in working for
    peace in Northern Ireland, Israel, and Bosnia. President
    Clinton has helped Central European and Newly Independent
    States develop their economies and solidify their democracies,
    and he has established a process for including newly democratic
    states into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. On domestic
    issues, President Clinton led the fight against crime by
    strengthening the death penalty and providing for 100,000 new
    police officers on the beat. The President also fought for
    working families by enacting the Family Medical Leave Act, by
    pushing for an increase in the minimum wage, and by steadfastly
    opposing cuts in education and Medicare, and attacks on the
    rights of workers.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Mr. Zherka most recently served as legislative counsel
    to Congressman George Miller where he was primarily responsible
    for international relations, labor, and crime issues. Zherka
    also worked as a member of the National Democratic Ethnic
    Coordinating Committee, to increase support for the reelection
    of the President. Additionally, Zherka led a grassroots effort
    in the Albanian American community to support the Senate bid of
    Congressman Bob Torrecelli.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"Ilir�s work experience on Capitol Hill and with ethnic
    communities makes him a tremendous asset to the campaign," said
    Alan Wheat, Deputy Campaign Manager and Director of Public
    Liaison. "Ethnic Americans are a central part of the Democratic
    Party, President Clinton received the strong support of Ethnic
    Americans in 1992, and with Ilir�s help I am confident the
    President will receive their support once again," said
    Wheat.</tt></p>
