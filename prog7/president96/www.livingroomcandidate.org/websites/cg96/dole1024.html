    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    October 24, 1996</tt>
    <center>
      <tt><b>STATEMENT BY JOE LOCKHART<br>
      NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>Another Bob Dole anniversary. Another Bob Dole vote
    against the issues that matter most to Americans. In 1965, Bob
    Dole voted against creating the Medicare program -- a program
    which preserves health care benefits for 37 million elderly and
    disabled Medicare beneficiaries. A year ago today, Bob Dole
    bragged about that 1965 vote against Medicare saying, "I was
    there, fighting the fight, voting against Medicare -- one of
    twelve -- because we knew it wouldn�t work in 1965."</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Thirty years later, Bob Dole is still "fighting the
    fight" against Medicare. The 1995 Dole/Gingrich budget cut
    Medicare by $270 billion -- the largest cut in history. And now
    he has a risky $550 billion tax scheme that threatens even
    deeper cuts in Medicare. Even his own campaign co-chair Al
    D�Amato said that Dole would have "to look at Medicare" to pay
    for his risky, budget scheme.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>President Clinton has fought to protect Medicare -- to
    bring security and dignity to the lives of our nation�s
    seniors. Meanwhile, Bob Dole has spent the last thirty years
    opposing and undermining Medicare -- delivering through his
    words and actions the frightening message that under his risky
    scheme no program is safe, not even Medicare.</tt></p>
