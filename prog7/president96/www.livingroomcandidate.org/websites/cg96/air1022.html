    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    October 22, 1996</tt>
    <center>
      <tt><b>TRANSCRIPT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON�S FREE AIR TIME
      REMARKS</b></tt>
      <p><tt>President Clinton�s remarks will be broadcast this
      evening, October 22, 1996, on the following stations: <i>CBS,
      CNN, C-SPAN, NBC, NOSTALGIA TELEVISION, NPR, PBS AND
      UPN</i>.</tt></p>

    <p><tt>We must make education our highest priority, so that all
    our children have the tools to make the most of their own
    lives. I want to build a bridge to the 21st century where we
    expand opportunity through education -- where computers are as
    much a part of the classroom as blackboards, where
    highly-trained teachers demand peak performance from our
    students, where every eight-year-old can point to a book and
    say, I can read that all by myself, and where everyone has a
    chance to go to college.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>We�ve started the job of improving school standards. Now
    math scores, science scores, and SAT scores are up. We�ve
    expanded Head Start, and increased scholarships and student
    loans and lowered the cost of those loans. We�re on the right
    track.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Now we should require that our students pass tough tests
    to move up in school. We should reward teachers who do well,
    and remove those who don�t. We should expand public school
    choice by opening 3,000 Charter schools, schools formed by
    teachers and parents, that survive only if they produce
    results. These schools are part of our balanced budget
    plan.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>We should make sure every child can read independently
    by the third grade, by mobilizing 30,000 reading tutors all
    across America. We should continue to rebuild and modernize our
    school, and make them safe and drug-free. We should finish the
    job of connecting every classroom to the Internet by the year
    2000.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>And above all, we should help everyone go to college
    because higher education is the key to the higher-paying jobs
    of the future. We should make sure the first two years of
    college are as universal as high school is today, by giving a
    tax credit of $1,500 for those years -- the cost of a typical
    community college tuition -- and we should give a $10,000 tax
    deduction for all college costs.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>My opponent disagrees with this approach. He voted
    against creating the Department of Education, and now he wants
    to abolish it. Just think about it: as we move into the 21st
    century, at his cabinet meetings, there would be no one at the
    table to fight for our children�s education. He also voted
    against the creation of Head Start and student loans. That�s
    the wrong approach for our children�s future.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>With my education strategy, we will make sure every
    eight-year old can read, every twelve-year-old can log onto the
    Internet, and every eighteen-year-old can go to college. That�s
    the way to give every child a chance at the American
    dream.</tt></p>
