    <p><tt>PRESS RELEASE<br>
    September 18, 1996</tt></p>
    <p><tt>PRESIDENT CLINTON�S CRIME INITIATIVES: MAKING A
    DIFFERENCE FOR LATINOS</tt></p>
    <p><tt>WASHINGTON--When comparing the crime record between
    President Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, the President wins by a
    knockout. In just four years, President Clinton has done more
    to help reduce crime in the Latino community than Bob Dole has
    done in 35 years as a Washington politician.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Under President Clinton, violent crime rates have gone
    down each and every year. In 1995, murder dropped by 8%, and
    robbery dropped by 7%. In addition, violent criminals are
    serving longer prison sentences. The average prison sentence
    for fire-arm related and violent crimes was 74.5 months in
    1992. In the first two years under President Clinton, the
    prison sentence for the same offenders was 88 months - more
    than a year longer.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>In addition, President Clinton has:<br>
    * Passed legislation to put 100,000 new police on the street.
    Thus far, over 44,000 police officers have been funded, and
    20,000 new police are on the streets.<br>
    * Passed the landmark Brady Bill after years of Republican
    stalling. This law has kept over 60,000 felons from getting
    guns.<br>
    * Passed the assault weapons ban</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"We're moving in the right direction. The new police
    officers are supporting people in the community - they're
    making a difference. We have to let the President finish the
    job," said Ken Mireles, Clinton/Gore �96 Director of Hispanic
    Outreach.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Bob Dole, on the other hand, has:<br>
    * Voted against the Brady Bill & the assault weapons ban<br>
    * Voted to cut Safe & Drug Free Schools Program by nearly
    half<br>
    * Voted against the Violence Against Women Act<br>
    * Voted against 100,000 new police</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"The record is clear, President Clinton is the real
    champion of Hispanic Americans when it comes to reducing crime.
    Bob Dole, meanwhile, is all talk," said Alan Wheat, Deputy
    Campaign Manager and Director of Public Liaison for
    Clinton/Gore �96. "The Brady Bill, the Assault Weapons Ban, and
    100,000 new police on the street--President Clinton is making a
    difference for the Latino community," added Michael Carbone,
    Clinton/Gore �96 Executive Director of Latino
    Outreach.</tt></p>
