    <b>KEEPING CAMPAIGN PROMISES</b>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> Knight-Ridder says President Clinton keeps
    his word. Knight-Ridder: �Nearly four years later, the record
    shows he has achieved most of [his promises].� In a
    comprehensive analysis, Knight-Ridder concluded that President
    Clinton had achieved 66% of his promises and would have
    achieved 79 percent if Congress had allowed him.
    [Knight-Ridder, 8/18/96] For example, in 1992, President
    Clinton said he would cut the deficit in half; he cut it by
    more than 60%. [CBO, 10/96] President Clinton said he would cut
    the federal payroll by 100,000 workers; he has now cut it by
    nearly 250,000. [Washington Post, 9/27/96; OPM, 9/96] President
    Clinton said he would �end welfare as we know it�; in August
    1996, he signed a welfare reform bill with time limits and
    tough work requirements. President Clinton said he would crack
    down on crime by putting 100,000 police officers on the
    streets, signing the Brady bill, and banning dangerous Assault
    Weapons; he delivered on all three. And President Clinton said
    that he would sign Family and Medical Leave, Goals 2000, Motor
    Voter, create a new direct student loan program, expand the
    EITC, increase the minimum wage, and create a National Service
    program; he has fulfilled each of these promises.
    [Knight-Ridder, 8/18/96] <a name="2" id="2"></a></p>
    <p><b>THE BEST ECONOMY IN 30 YEARS</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> The conservative business journal Barron�s
    -- and Bob Dole himself last February -- called the economy the
    best in over 30 years. [Barron�s 3/18/96, Dole Remarks before
    the New Hampshire State Legislature, 2/13/96 -- transcript
    released by the Dole campaign, 2/20/96] Under President
    Clinton, the private sector of the economy has grown 3.2
    percent -- that�s stronger than either the Reagan (3.0%) or
    Bush (1.3%). [Based on data from the Department of Commerce,
    9/96] According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 10.5 million
    new jobs have been created under President Clinton.
    Unemployment is down from 7.5% to 5.2%, the lowest in 7 �
    years. Family income is up by over $1600 since 1993. We have
    the lowest combined mortgage, unemployment and inflation rates
    in 28 years. Real wages are up for the first time in a decade.
    [Bureau of Labor Statistics, 10/96, Census, 9/96] <a name="3"
    id="3"></a></p>
    <p><b>CALIFORNIA</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> Our economic recovery has created 10 and a
    half million jobs nation-wide, 705,000 of them in California,
    after we lost 60,000 jobs in California during the Bush years.
    [BLS, 10/96] These are good jobs and many defense workers have
    moved into them. And we are converting closed military bases to
    civilian use. Fort Ord, in Monterey, is now the site of a
    University of California/Cal State University branch. The
    Sacramento Army Depot, closed in March 1995, is now the site of
    a Packard Bell manufacturing plant and headquarters -- 4,000
    jobs were created there last year alone, more than the original
    3,000 civilian DOD workers who had been employed there. Long
    Beach Naval Station is now the site of a major reuse project
    which includes the world�s largest shipping firm and a branch
    of Boeing. [Mayor O�Neill, 2/23/96] <a name="4" id="4"></a></p>
    <p><b>DOLE MEDICARE CUTS</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> Under the Dole-Gingrich plan to cut
    Medicare by $270 billion, Medicare would have spent $1,400 less
    per person in 2002 than it will without these cuts. This would
    lower spending per person to more than 20% below private sector
    premium growth rates. [Administration estimates of based on CBO
    assumptions of private sector premium growth rates, August
    1995; CBO, �The Economic and Budget Outlook,� p.84;
    Administration estimates based off of CBO March 1995 baseline]
    At the same time, their plan would increase premiums by $1,700
    per couple over the next seven years and by $269 per couple in
    1996 alone. [Administration estimates based on CBO 12/13/95
    assumptions] That�s a cut. According to the American Hospital
    Association, �[r]eductions of this magnitude would result not
    in a reduction in the rate of growth, but in a real cut.�
    [Letter to Senator Dole, 10/16/95] According to the American
    Association of Retired Persons, � . . .The proposal passed by
    the Senate would cut . . . much more than is necessary to keep
    the program solvent. [Statement by Horace Deets, 10/27/95] As
    for Dole�s economic plan, 83% of economists surveyed by the
    Economist said that the Dole plan would force even deeper cuts
    in Medicare. [The Economist, 10/5/96]</p>
    <p>President Clinton�s balanced budget extends the life of the
    Trust Fund for a decade from today -- the same as the
    Republican budget plan. [Letter from Medicare Chief Actuary,
    6/4/96.] The 1993 Clinton Economic Plan, opposed by Senator
    Dole and enacted without a single Republican vote, extended the
    life of the Trust Fund by 3 years. [Memo from Medicare Chief
    Actuary to HCFA Administrator, 3/28/95] Senator Dole doesn�t
    even believe in the program: "I was there, fighting the fight,
    one of twelve, voting against Medicare in 1965 ... because we
    knew it wouldn't work." [American Conservative Union Speech,
    10/24/95] <a name="5" id="5"></a></p>
    <p><b>TOBACCO</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> The bill that Dole voted for in 1965 --
    the so-called �Cigarette Labeling Act� -- was considered a
    �victory for the cigarette industry� because it superseded
    regulations by the Federal Trade Commission, which would have
    required health warnings in cigarette advertising on radio,
    television, newspapers and other media. The industry calls him
    �a valuable friend� because of his years of support for it. The
    President took on the industry beginning in the first six
    months of his term. [1965 CQ Almanac, vt. 90, p. 978, 7/13/65;
    1965 CQ Almanac, p. 344. October 1989 memo from James W. Dyer,
    then director of Public Relations for Philip Morris, FDA/HHS
    Fact Sheet, 8/23/96, HHS Fact Sheet, January 17, 1995.] Even
    tonight, Senator Dole, who previously compared smoking to the
    dangers of drinking milk, said: �Are they addictive? They
    probably are. I don�t know. I am not a doctor.� <a name="6" id=
    "6"></a></p>
    <p><b>DEFENSE BUDGET</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> There is only a 1% difference between the
    President�s defense budget and the Republican�s current budget
    over 6 years, and the President�s budget provides $7 billion
    more than Republicans in FY2002. [OMB comparison of President�s
    FY97 budget and GOP FY97 budget resolution defense
    discretionary funding FY97-2002]. Our plan for the future
    invests in modernizing our weaponry -- reversing the downward
    trend in procurement with a 40% increase the next six years;
    readiness is at high levels; retired General Edward Meyer, head
    of a task force reviewing readiness, stated that �what we call
    an acceptable level of readiness today would in the 70s have
    been regarded as unattainable pie-in-the-sky...� [General
    Accounting Office, 8/95]. In reality, the Clinton defense
    budgets are scarcely different from the Cold War defense
    budgets in constant dollars. <a name="7" id="7"></a></p>
    <p><b>PARDONS</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> President Clinton made his position very
    clear in the Hartford debate: no special treatment for anyone,
    period. It is Senator Dole who has been a big fan of
    presidential pardons throughout his career. Former Iran-Contra
    prosecutor Lawrence Walsh said Dole�s attempt to use the issue
    against Clinton is �hypocrisy� because �Dole, himself, had
    urged pardons for crimes of constitutional dimension committed
    in office by a Reagan cabinet officer.� [AP News, 10/15/96.]
    When it was suggested that President Bush might stop at Caspar
    Weinberger�s unusual pre-conviction pardon, Dole pushed Bush to
    go further: �If you�re going to do one, you do them all.� [Face
    the Nation, CBS, 11/92.] In 1992, Dole called Bush�s pardons of
    five Iran-Contra defendants an �act of courage and compassion.�
    [New York Times, 10/16/96.] In 1976, Dole said of President
    Ford�s pardon of Nixon, �he did the right thing.� [New York
    Times, 10/16/96.] <a name="8" id="8"></a></p>
    <p><b>ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND BENEFITS</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> Illegal immigrants are explicitly
    prohibited from receiving AFDC, Food Stamps, SSI, and Medicaid
    (with the exception of emergency Medicaid). Public welfare
    agencies administering these programs verify the eligibility of
    all applicants through the INS. [Brooks Jackson, CNN Inside
    Politics, 6/27/96; Section 402(a)(33) of the Act (42 USC
    602(a)(33); Section 6(f) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 USC
    2015(f); Section 1614(a)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act (42
    USC 1382c(a)(1)(B); Section 1903(v) of the Social Security Act
    (42 USC 1396b(v)] <a name="9" id="9"></a></p>
    <p><b>DRUGS</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> President Clinton has fought the drug war
    on all fronts. Casual drug use is down 13% among Americans
    between the ages of 18 and 35 since 1992 (Department of Health
    and Human Services, Substance Abuse/Mental Health Agency,
    8/20/96). Cocaine use is down 30% since 1992 (ONDCP, April
    1996). There is a record number of drug felons in federal
    prisons (Letter from Attorney General Reno to Senator Orrin
    Hatch, 9/26/96). Border Patrol drug seizures are up 22%
    (Department of Justice/ Immigration and Naturalization Service,
    07/0796). President Clinton has proposed and signed the largest
    anti-drug budgets in history, up 24% since FY93; he elevated
    the Office of National Drug Control Policy to Cabinet level
    status; and he appointed a four-star general, Barry McCaffrey,
    to lead the fight. By contrast, Bob Dole opposed the creation
    of the Drug Czar�s office in 1982 and voted against its
    extension in 1994. [1994 CQ Almanac, p.290] [CQ Almanac, 1982
    (p.64-S)] Bob Dole voted to cut the Safe and Drug Free Schools
    Program by 50%. The Dole-Gingrich budget cut $767 million for
    the President�s 1996 drug control budget and cut at risk youth
    drug programs by over 50%. [CQ, 1994, vt 321, Impact of House
    Appropriations Subcommittee mark, FY95-97.]</p>
    <p>Regarding San Diego drug felony cases, in just the first
    four months of 1996, fully half of the felony drug cases filed
    by the United States Attorney in San Diego were in this
    category (92 out of 184). The United States Attorney�s Office
    in San Diego filed a record number of drug and immigration
    related felony charges in 1995 -- doubling the number of felony
    drug prosecutions over the prior year -- and border drug,
    criminal alien and alien smuggling cases made up 90% of the
    total felonies filed by the San Diego U.S. Attorney�s office in
    1995. [Letter from Attorney General Reno to Senator Hatch, May
    21, 1995]. According to Sheriff William B. Kolender of the San
    Diego County Sheriff�s Department, �I have seen a lot of U.S.
    Attorneys, but in my mind, the cooperation between the federal
    government, and state and local law enforcement has never been
    better.� [Letter from Sheriff William B. Kolender to Attorney
    General Reno, May 17, 1996] <a name="10" id="10"></a></p>
    <p><b>MANUFACTURING JOBS</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> After losing 2.1 million manufacturing
    jobs during the Reagan-Bush years, the economy has added
    120,000 manufacturing jobs under President Clinton -- a faster
    annual rate of manufacturing job growth than any Republican
    Administration since before the Great Depression. [Based on
    data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 10/4/96.] <a name=
    "11" id="11"></a></p>
    <p><b>WELFARE</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> In fact, the Dole/Gingrich bills the
    President vetoed would have denied food and health care to
    millions of children. It was only over Dole�s objections that
    President Clinton, working with Republicans and Democrats,
    achieved passage of a welfare reform bill that dropped the
    Republican proposals for deep cuts in the school lunch program,
    as well as their proposed cuts in foster care, adoption
    assistance and child abuse prevention. And, at his insistence,
    it maintained the guarantee of health insurance for poor
    children and pregnant women. [Personal Responsibility and Work
    Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, P.L. 104-193; HHS fact
    sheet, August 1996] <a name="12" id="12"></a></p>
    <p><b>EDUCATION</b></p>
    <p><b>THE FACTS:</b> Education funding increased because
    President Clinton stopped the Republican education cuts.
    Senator Dole voted against an amendment to reduce the student
    loan cuts in the Senate budget plan by $9.4 billion from $13
    billion [CQ Almanac, Senate vote 231, 5/25/95]. His budget
    would have capped the direct lending program, effectively
    ending direct loans that allow students to repay their loans as
    a share of their income. [HR 2491, 11/17/95] Senator Dole also
    voted for the Senate budget plan that would have frozen funding
    for Pell Grants over 7 years, which would have forced a
    reduction in the size of the grants and the number of students
    receiving them. [Senate FY96 budget resolution committee
    report]. And Dole voted against restoring funding for Pell
    Grants so they could keep up with the pace of inflation and
    enrollment. [Senate vote #220, 5/25/95] The Dole-Gingrich
    budget last year would have cut Pell Grants, denying Pell
    Grants to at least 100,000 students. [OMB, 9/96] This year,
    President Clinton won his request for the largest increase in
    the maximum Pell Grant in over 20 years, reaching 126,000 more
    students than last year. [OMB, 9/96]</p>
