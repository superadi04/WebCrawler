    PRESS RELEASE<br>
    October 30, 1996</tt>
    <center>
      <tt><b>"JUST VOTE! �96" TOUR TAKES LATINO LEADERS AND
      CELEBRITIES TO CLINTON/GORE GOTV RALLIES NATIONWIDE</b></tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>The Clinton/Gore �96 campaign today announced it will
    launch the "Just Vote! �96 Tour" through the Southwest and
    Eastern seaboard November 1 - 4. The Tour will take Latino
    leaders and celebrities nationwide to encourage Latino voters
    and key Democratic constituencies to �tune in and turn out� on
    Election Day.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The "Just Vote! �96 Tour" will consist of Clinton/Gore
    GOTV rallies, press events, youth visits, and canvassing
    neighborhoods. There will be two tours, one going through the
    Southwest and the other along the East Coast.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The four-day tour will be kicked off at a news
    conference featuring Honorary Campaign Chair Linda
    Chavez-Thompson; Henry Cisneros, who is Secretary of Housing
    and Urban Develop- ment; and Federico Pena, who is Secretary of
    Transportation; on Friday, November 1, at 9:30 a.m. at the
    Guadalupe Center in San Antonio, Texas.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Participants in the Southwest "Just Vote! �96 Tour" will
    include comedian Jeff Valdez, TV personality Johnny Canales,
    Henry Cisneros, Federico Pena, and others. The Southwest Tour
    begins in Corpus Christi and will go through Laredo and Del
    Rio, Texas on November 1. The Southwest Tour will return to San
    Antonio for a rally with President Clinton and then proceed to
    Tucson, Arizona on November 2. On November 3, the Southwest
    Tour travels to Pueblo, Colorado; Las Vegas, New Mexico; and
    Reno, Nevada. The Tour continues on November 4 with stops in
    Monterey, Fresno and the Central Valley, Santa Ana, and San
    Diego, California.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The Eastern Coast Tour will include Salsa/Merengue
    singer Willie Colon, the Barrio Boyz musical group, and actor
    Michael di Lorenzo. It will stop in Union City, New Jersey on
    November 2 and Orlando, Florida on November 3.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>"The 'Just Vote! �96 Tour' is a high-impact Clinton/Gore
    GOTV effort designed to energize and mobilize Democratic
    constituencies and to build enthusiasm with leaders and
    celebrities seen as role models in their communities," said
    Alan Wheat, Clinton/Gore Deputy Campaign Manager. The rallies
    and events will reach into the heart of the nation�s Latino
    communities from the Alamo in San Antonio to the barrios of
    Chicano Park in San Diego and Union City, New Jersey.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>This GOTV initiative builds on the Clinton/Gore �96
    campaign�s "Adelante con Clinton/Gore" committee and other
    efforts to reach out to diverse Democratic constituencies and
    raise turnout to historic levels. "The stakes for Hispanic
    Americans in this election are very high," said Mickey Ibarra,
    Senior Campaign Advisor and Director of Special Projects.
    Further, he said, "the Tour will help us come together as
    Latinos to re-elect President Clinton and elect other Democrats
    because of their strong commitment to our community."</tt></p>
