              California is the country�s largest agricultural
              exporting state, shipping $6.4 billion in
              agricultural exports abroad or 14.8% of the U.S.
              total in 1994 (latest year available for Department
              of Agriculture state export data). The largest export
              categories, fruit, tree nuts, and vegetables,
              accounted for over 64 percent of California�s
              agricultural exports in 1994. Given the 22 percent
              increase in total U.S. agriculture exports in 1995,
              agriculture exports from California in 1995 will
              likely range between $7.7 billion and $8.0 billion.
