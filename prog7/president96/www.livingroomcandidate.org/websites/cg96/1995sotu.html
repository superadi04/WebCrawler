    <p>(Applause, cheers.) Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank
    you. Thank you. (Continued cheers, applause.) Thank you. Thank
    you. Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, members of the 104th Congress,
    my fellow Americans, again we are here in the sanctuary of
    democracy, and once again our democracy has spoken. So let me
    begin by congratulating all of you here in the 104th Congress
    and congratulating you, Mr. Speaker. (Applause.) If we agree on
    nothing else tonight, we must agree that the American people
    certainly voted for change in 1992 and in 1994. (Applause.) And
    as I look out at you, I know how some of you must have felt in
    1992! (Laughter.) But—(laughs)—(applause)—I must say that in
    both years we didn’t hear America singing, we heard America
    shouting, and now all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike,
    must say,&nbsp;“We hear you. We will work together to earn the
    jobs you have given us.”(Applause.) For we are the keepers of a
    sacred trust and we must be faithful to it in this new and very
    demanding era.</p>
    <p>Over 200 years ago, our founders changed the entire course
    of human history by joining together to create a new country
    based on a single powerful idea: We hold these truths to be
    self-evident, that all men are created equal, endowed by their
    Creator with certain inalienable rights, and among these are
    life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</p>
    <p>It has fallen to every generation since then to preserve
    that idea, the American idea, and to deepen and expand its
    meaning in new and different times. To Lincoln and to his
    Congress, to preserve the Union and to end slavery. To Theodore
    Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, to restrain the abuses and
    excesses of the Industrial Revolution and to assert our
    leadership in the world. To Franklin Roosevelt, to fight the
    failure and pain of the Great Depression, and to win our
    country’s great struggle against fascism. And to all our
    presidents since, to fight the Cold War.</p>
    <p>Especially I recall two who struggled to fight that Cold War
    in partnership with Congresses where the majority was of a
    different party. To Harry Truman, who summoned us to
    unparalleled prosperity at home, and who built the architecture
    of the Cold War, and to Ronald Reagan, whom we wish well
    tonight, and who exhorted us to carry on until the twilight
    struggle against Communism was won. (Applause.)</p>
    <p>In another time of change and challenge I had the honor to
    be the first president to be elected in the post Cold War era,
    an era marked by the global economy, the information
    revolution, unparalleled change and opportunity and security
    for the American people. I came to this hallowed chamber two
    years ago on a mission, to restore the American dream for all
    our people and to make sure that we move into the 21st century
    still the strongest force for freedom and democracy in the
    entire world.</p>
    <p>I was determined then to tackle the tough problems too long
    ignored. In this effort, I am frank to say that I have made my
    mistakes, and I have learned again the importance of humility
    in all human endeavor. But I am also proud to say tonight that
    our country is stronger than it was two years ago. (Applause.)
    Record numbers of Americans are succeeding in the new global
    economy. We are at peace, and we are a force for peace and
    freedom throughout the world. We have almost six million new
    jobs since I became president, and we have the lowest combined
    rate of unemployment and inflation in 25 years. (Applause.) Our
    businesses are more productive, and here we have worked to
    bring the deficit, to expand trade, to put more police on our
    streets, to give our citizens more of the tools they need to
    get an education and to rebuild their own communities. But the
    rising tide is not lifting all boats. While our nation is
    enjoying peace and prosperity, too many of our people are still
    working harder and harder for less and less. While our
    businesses are restructuring and growing more productive and
    competitive, too many of our people still can’t be sure of
    having a job next year or even next month. And far more than
    our material riches are threatened, things far more precious to
    us: our children, our families, our values.</p>
    <p>Our civil life is suffering in America today. Citizens are
    working together less and shouting at each other more. The
    common bonds of community which have been the great strength of
    our country from its very beginning are badly frayed.</p>
    <p>What are we to do about it? More than 60 years ago, at the
    dawn of another new era, President Roosevelt told our nation
    new conditions imposed new requirements on government and those
    who conduct government. And from that simple proposition, he
    shaped the New Deal, which helped to restore our nation to
    prosperity and defined the relationship between our people and
    our government for half a century. That approach worked in its
    time, but we today, we face a very different time and very
    different conditions. We are moving from an industrial age
    built on gears and sweat to an information age demanding skills
    and learning and flexibility. Our government, once a champion
    of national purposes, is now seen by many as simply a captive
    of narrow interests, putting more burdens on our citizens
    rather than equipping them to get ahead. The values that used
    to hold us all together seem to be coming apart. So tonight, we
    must forge a new social compact to meet the challenges of this
    time. As we enter a new era, we need a new set of
    understandings, not just with government but even more
    important with one another as Americans. That’s what I want to
    talk with you about tonight. I call it the New Covenant, but
    it’s grounded in a very, very old idea: that all Americans have
    not just a right but a solemn responsibility to rise as far as
    their God-given talents and determination can take them, and to
    give something back to their communities and their country in
    return. Opportunity and responsibility, they go hand in hand;
    we can’t have one without the other, and our national community
    can’t hold together without both. (Applause.) Our new covenant
    is a new set of understanding for how we can equip our people
    to meet the challenges of the new economy, how we can change
    the way our government works to fit a different time, and above
    all, how we can repair the damaged bonds in our society and
    come together behind our common purpose.</p>
    <p>We must have dramatic change in our economy, our government
    and ourselves. My fellow Americans, without regard to party,
    let us rise to the occasion. Let us put aside partisanship and
    pettiness and pride. As we embark on this new course, let us
    put our country, remembering that regardless of party label we
    are all Americans. And let the final test of everything we do
    be a simple one: Is it good for the American people?
    (Applause.) Let me begin by saying that we cannot ask Americans
    to be better citizens if we are not better servants. You’ve
    made a good start by passing that law which applies to Congress
    all the laws you put on the private sector, and I was proud to
    sign it yesterday. (Applause, cheers.)</p>
    <p>But we have a lot more to do before people really trust the
    way things work around here. Three times as many lobbyists are
    in the streets and corridors of Washington as were here 20
    years ago. The American people look at their capital and they
    see a city where the well-connected and the well-protected can
    work the system, but the interests of ordinary citizens are
    often left out. As the new Congress opened its doors, lobbyists
    were still doing business as usual—the gifts, the trips, all
    the things that people are concerned about haven’t stopped.
    Twice this month you missed opportunities to stop these
    practices. I know there were other considerations in those
    votes, but I want to use something that I’ve heard my
    Republican friends say from time to time, there doesn’t have to
    be a law for everything. So tonight, I ask you to just stop
    taking the lobbyist perks. Just stop. (Applause, cheers.)</p>
    <p>We don’t have to wait for legislation to pass to send a
    strong signal to the American people that things are really
    changing. But I also hope you will send me the strongest
    possible lobby reform bill, and I’ll sign that too. (Applause.)
    We should require lobbyists to tell the people for whom they
    work, what they’re spending, what they want. We should also
    curb the role of big money in elections by capping the costs of
    campaigns and limiting the influence of PACs. (Applause.) And
    as I have said for three years, we should work to open the
    airwaves so that they can be an instrument of democracy, not a
    weapon of destruction, by giving free TV time to candidates for
    public office. (Applause.) When the last Congress killed
    political reform last year, it was reported in the press that
    the lobbyists actually stood in the halls of this sacred
    building and cheered. This year let’s give the folks at home
    something to cheer about. (Applause.)</p>
    <p>More important, I think we all agree that we have to change
    the way the government works. Let’s make it smaller, less
    costly and smarter, leaner not meaner. (Applause.) I just told
    the Speaker the equal time doctrine is alive and well.
    (Laughter.) The New Covenant approach to governing is as
    different from the old bureaucratic way as the computer is from
    the manual typewriter. The old way of governing around here
    protected organized interests. We should look out for the
    interests of ordinary people. The old way divided us by
    interests, constituency or class.</p>
    <p>The New Covenant way should unite us behind a common vision
    of what’s best for our country.</p>
    <p>The old way dispensed services through large top-down,
    inflexible bureaucracies. The New Covenant way should shift
    these resources and decision-making from bureaucrats to
    citizens, injecting choice and competition and individual
    responsibility into national policy. (Applause.)</p>
    <p>The old way of governing around here actually seemed to
    reward failure. The New Covenant way should have built-in
    incentives to reward success. The old way was centralized here
    in Washington. The New Covenant way must take hold in the
    communities all across America, and we should help them to do
    that. (Applause.)</p>
    <p>Our job here is to expand opportunity, not bureaucracy, to
    empower people to make the most of their own lives—(cheers,
    applause)—and to enhance our security here at home and
    abroad.</p>
    <p>We must not ask government to do what we should do for
    ourselves. We should rely on government as a partner to help us
    to do more for ourselves and for each other. (Applause.)</p>
    <p>I hope very much that, as we debate these specific and
    exciting matters, we can go beyond the sterile discussion
    between the illusion that there is somehow a program for every
    problem on the one hand and the other illusion that the
    government is the source of every problem we have. Our job is
    to get rid of yesterday’s government so that our own people can
    meet today’s and tomorrow’s needs, and we ought to do it
    together. (Applause.)</p>
    <p>You know, for years before I became president I heard others
    say they would cut government and how bad it was, but not much
    happened. We actually did it. We cut over a quarter of a
    trillion dollars in spending, more than 300 domestic programs,
    more than 100,000 positions from the federal bureaucracy in the
    last two years alone. Based on decisions already made, we will
    have cut a total of more than a quarter of a million positions
    from the federal government, making it the smallest it has been
    since John Kennedy was president by the time I come here again
    next year. (Applause.)</p>
    <p>Under the leadership of Vice President Gore, our initiatives
    have already saved taxpayers $63 billion. The age of the $500
    hammer and the ash tray you can break on David Letterman is
    gone. (Laughter.) Dead-wood programs like mohair subsidies are
    gone. We streamlined the Agriculture Department by reducing it
    by more than 1,200 offices. We’ve slashed the small business
    loan form from and inch thick to a single page. We’ve thrown
    away the government’s 10,000-page personnel manual, and the
    government is working better in important ways. FEMA, the
    Federal Emergency Management Agency has gone from being a
    disaster to helping people in disasters. (Applause.) You can
    ask the farmers in the middle west who fought the flood there
    or the people in California who’ve dealt with floods and
    earthquakes and fires, and they’ll tell you that. Government
    workers working hand in hand with private business rebuilt
    southern California’s fractured freeways in record time and
    under budget. And because the federal government moved fast,
    all but one of the 5,600 schools damaged in the earthquake are
    back in business. Now, there are a lot other things that I
    could talk about; I want to just mention one because it’ll be
    discussed here in the next few weeks. University administrators
    all over the country have told me that they are saving weeks
    and weeks of bureaucratic time now because of our direct
    college loan program, which makes college loans cheaper and
    more affordable with better repayment terms for students, costs
    the government less and cuts our paperwork and bureaucracy for
    the government and for the universities. We shouldn’t cap that
    program; we should give every college in America the
    opportunity to be a part of it. (Applause.)</p>
    <p>Previous government programs gathered dust. The reinventing
    government report is getting results. And we’re not through.
    There’s going to be a second round of reinventing government.
    We propose to cut $130 billion in spending by shrinking
    departments, extending our freeze on domestic spending, cutting
    60 public housing programs down to three, getting rid of over
    100 programs we do not need, like the Interstate Commerce
    Commission and the Helium Reserve Program. (Cheers,
    applause.)</p>
    <p>And we’re working on getting rid of unnecessary regulations
    and making them more sensible. The programs and regulations
    that have outlived their usefulness should go. We have to cut
    yesterday’s government to help solve tomorrow’s problems.
    (Applause.) And we need to get government closer to the people
    it’s meant to serve. We need to help move programs down to the
    point where states and communities and private citizens in the
    private sector can do a better job; if they can do it, we ought
    to let them do it. We should get out of the way and let them do
    what they can do better. (Applause.) Taking power away from
    federal bureaucracies and giving it back to communities and
    individuals is something everyone should be able to be for.
    It’s time for Congress to stop passing on to the states the
    cost of decisions we make here in Washington. (Cheers,
    applause.) I know there are still serious differences over the
    details of the unfunded mandates legislation, but I want to
    work with you to make sure we pass a reasonable bill which will
    protect the national interest and give justified relief where
    we need to give it. (Applause.)</p>
    <p>For years Congress concealed in the budget scores of pet
    spending projects. Last year was no different. There was a
    million dollars to study stress in plants and $12 million for a
    tick removal program that didn’t work. It’s hard to remove
    ticks, those of us who’ve had them know. (Laughter.) But I’ll
    tell you something, if you’ll give me the line-item veto, I’ll
    remove some of that unnecessary spending. (Cheers,
    applause.)</p>
    <p>But—(groans and moans)—I think we should all remember,and
    almost all of us would agree, that government still has
    important responsibilities. Our young people, we should think
    of this when we cut, our young people hold our future in their
    hands. We still owe a debt to our veterans. (Applause.) And our
    senior citizens have made us what we are. Now my budget cuts a
    lot, but it protects education, veterans, Social Security and
    Medicare, and I hope you will do the same thing. You should and
    I hope you will. (Applause.)</p>
    <p>And when we give more flexibility to the states, let us
    remember that there are certain fundamental national needs that
    should be addressed in every state, North and South, East and
    West. Immunization against childhood disease. (Applause.)
    School lunches in all our schools. (Applause.) Head Start,
    medical care, nutrition for pregnant women and infants.
    (Applause.) Medical care and nutrition for pregnant women and
    infants, all these things. (Applause.) All these things are in
    the national interest.</p>
    <p>I applaud your desire to get rid of costly and unnecessary
    regulations, but when we deregulate, let’s remember what
    national action in the national interest has given us: safer
    food for our families, safer toys for our children, safer
    nursing homes for our parents, safer cars and highways, and
    safer workplaces, cleaner air and cleaner water.</p>
    <p>Do we need common sense and fairness in our regulations? You
    bet we do. But we can have common sense and still provide for
    safe drinking water. We can have fairness and still clean up
    toxic dumps, and we ought to do it. (Applause.) Should we cut
    the deficit more? Well, of course we should. Of course we
    should. (Applause.) But we can bring it down in a way that
    still protects our economic recovery and does not unduly punish
    people who should not be punished and instead should be helped.
    I know many of you in this chamber support the balanced-budget
    amendment. (Applause.) I certainly want to balance the budget.
    Our administration has done more to bring the budget down and
    to save money than any in a very, very long time. (Applause.)
    If you believe passing this amendment is the right thing to do,
    then you have to be straight with the American people. They
    have a right to know what you’re going to cut, what taxes
    you’re going to raise—(sustained applause)—and how it’s going
    to affect them.</p>
    <p>We should be doing things in the open around here. For
    example, everybody ought to know if this proposal is going to
    endanger Social Security. I would oppose that, and I think most
    Americans would. (Applause.)</p>
    <p>Nothing has done more to undermine our sense of common
    responsibility than our failed welfare system. This is one of
    the problems we have to face here in Washington in our New
    Covenant. It rewards welfare over work; it undermines family
    values; it lets millions of parent get away without paying
    their child support; it keeps a minority but a significant
    minority of the people on welfare trapped on it for a very long
    time. I’ve worked on this problem for a long time, nearly 15
    years now. As a governor, I had the honor of working with the
    Reagan administration to write the last welfare reform bill
    back in 1988. In the last two years, we made a good start in
    continuing the work of welfare reform. Our administration gave
    two dozen states the right to slash through federal rules and
    regulations to reform their own welfare systems and to try to
    promote work and responsibility over welfare and dependency.
    Last year, I introduced the most sweeping welfare reform plan
    ever presented by an administration.</p>
    <p>We have to make welfare what it was meant to be—a second
    chance, not a way of life. We have to help those on welfare
    move to work as quickly as possible, to provide child care and
    teach them skills if that’s what they need, for up to two
    years. But after that, there ought to be a simple, hard rule:
    anyone who can work must go to work. (Applause.) If the parent
    isn’t paying child support, they should be forced to pay.
    (Applause.) We should suspend drivers licenses, track them
    across state lines, make them work off what they owe. That is
    what we should do. Governments do not raise children, people
    do, and the parents must take responsibility for the children
    they bring into this world. (Applause.) I want to work with
    you, with all of you, to pass welfare reform. But our goal must
    be to liberate people and lift them up from dependence to
    independence, from welfare to work, from mere child-bearing to
    responsible parenting. Our goal should not be to punish them
    because they happen to be poor. (Applause.) We should, we
    should require work and mutual responsibility, but we shouldn’t
    cut people off just because they’re poor, they’re young, or
    even because they’re unmarried. We should promote
    responsibility by requiring young mothers to live at home with
    their parents or in other supervised settings, by requiring
    them to finish school, but we shouldn’t put them and their
    children out on the street. (Applause.)</p>
    <p>And—(continued applause). And I know all the arguments pro
    and con, and I have read and thought about this for a long
    time. I still don’t think we can in good conscience punish poor
    children for the mistakes of their parents. (Applause.) Now, my
    fellow Americans, every single survey shows that all the
    American people care about this without regard to party or race
    or region. So let this be the year we end welfare as we know
    it. But also let this be the year that we are all able to stop
    using this issue to divide America. No one is more eager to end
    welfare. (Applause.)</p>
    <p>I may be the only president who has actually had the
    opportunity to sit in the welfare office, who has actually
    spent hours and hours talking to people on welfare. And I am
    telling you, the people who are trapped on it know it doesn’t
    work. They also want to get off.</p>
    <p>So we can promote together education, and work, and good
    parenting. I have no problem with punishing bad behavior, or
    the refusal to be a worker or a student, or a responsible
    parent. I just don’t want to punish poverty and past mistakes.
    All of us have made our mistakes, and none of us can change our
    yesterdays, but every one of us can change our tomorrows.
    (Applause.) And America’s best example of that may be Lynn
    Woolsey, who worked her way off welfare to become a
    Congresswoman, from the state of California. (Applause.)</p>
    <p>I know the members of this Congress are concerned about
    crime, as are all the citizens of our country. But I remind you
    that last year we passed a very tough crime bill, longer
    sentences, &nbsp;“Three Strikes and You’re Out,” almost 60 new
    capital punishment offenses, more prisons, more prevention,
    100,000 more police. And we paid for it all by reducing the
    size of the federal bureaucracy and giving the money back to
    local communities to lower the crime rate. There may be other
    things we can do to be tougher on crime, to be smarter with
    crime, to help to lower that rate first. Well, if there are,
    let’s talk about them and let’s do them. But let’s not go back
    on the things that we did last year that we know work, that we
    know work because the local law enforcement officers tell us
    that we did the right thing, because local community leaders
    who’ve worked for years and years to lower the crime rate tell
    us that they work. Let’s look at the experience of our cities
    and our rural areas where the crime rate has gone down, and ask
    the people who did it, how they did it. And if what we did last
    year supports the decline</p>
