    <p><tt>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
    September 23, 1996</tt></p>
    <p><tt>STATEMENT OF JOE LOCKHART<br>
    NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY</tt></p>
    <p><tt>In a desperate attempt to try to find a message for his
    campaign, Bob Dole continues his negative attacks against the
    President. But what�s missing from his speeches and
    advertisements is any discussion of his own record of 35 years
    in Congress:</tt></p>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>"But there is one place that Dole hardly ever
      mentions: Washington, D.C. It�s as if the most important part
      of his life ended when ... when he entered politics." (U.S.
      News & World Report, 9/2/96);</tt></li>
      <li><tt>In his acceptance speech in San Diego, Bob Dole
      barely mentioned the Congress in a 50 minute
      address;</tt></li>
      <li><tt>In a critique of Bob Dole�s 30 minute infomercial
      "Portrait of a Man" the New York Times wrote "the
      advertisement ... utterly shorn of Bob Dole�s economic
      proposals and even his experience in the United States
      Senate." (9/5/96).</tt></li>
    </ul>
    <p><tt>Today, September 23, 1996, the Clinton/Gore '96 campaign
    announces a new ad entitled "Wrong In The Past". "Wrong in the
    Past" is designed to fill the 35 year issue and legislative gap
    left by the Dole campaign.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>The text of the ad follows:</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Wrong In The Past</tt></p>
    <p><tt><i>Let�s go back in time. The �60s. Bob Dole�s in
    Congress.</i></tt></p>
    <p><tt><i>Votes against creating Medicare. Against creating
    student loans.</i></tt></p>
    <p><tt><i>(1970s)</i></tt></p>
    <p><tt><i>Against the Department of Education. Against a higher
    minimum wage</i></tt></p>
    <p><tt><i>(1980s)</i></tt></p>
    <p><tt><i>Still there. Against creating a drug czar. Against
    the Brady Bill to fight crime.</i></tt></p>
    <p><tt><i>(1990s)</i></tt></p>
    <p><tt><i>Against Family and Medical Leave. Against vaccines
    for children.</i></tt></p>
    <p><tt><i>Against Medicare - again. Dole-Gingrich tried to cut
    270 billion.</i></tt></p>
    <p><tt><i>Bob Dole. Wrong in the past. Wrong for our
    future.</i></tt></p>
