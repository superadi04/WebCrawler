      <tt>TRANSCRIPT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON�S<br>
      FREE AIR TIME REMARKS ON THE FOX NETWORK</tt>
    </center>
    <p><tt>QUESTION: Many people believe that too much money is
    spent on foreign aid, boosting the economies of countries like
    the former Soviet Union, at the expense of the United States.
    Explain why this is a good idea.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>PRESIDENT CLINTON: I am committed to keeping America the
    world�s strongest force for peace, freedom, and prosperity, to
    defend our security and protect our values. A smart, limited
    foreign aid program must be a part of that.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>Foreign aid is just one penny out of every tax dollar we
    spend. But if we can help freedom take root in countries that
    once threatened our security, that�s money well-spent. Today,
    no Russian missiles are pointed at America�s children. I want
    to keep it that way.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>While we reward democracies, we must penalize
    terrorists, fighting them on three fronts: Toughening our laws
    to punish terrorists. Tightening airport security. And rallying
    the world to a policy of zero tolerance for terrorism, which
    means isolating rogue states. As long as Iran trains
    terrorists, as long as Lybia refuses to give up those who blew
    up Pan Am 103, they must pay a price.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>America will maintain its leadership, fight terrorism,
    and keep our defenses the strongest in the world.</tt></p>
