  Missing"</b></font></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">That's when the
  Germans saw him. Seconds later, an exploding shell ripped into
  his right shoulder - shattering his collarbone, smashing part of
  his spine and leaving his arm dangling. "I lay face down in the
  dirt," Bob Dole said. "I could not see or move my arms. I thought
  they were missing."</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">After the battle,
  one of his men gave him a shot of morphine and marked his
  forehead with an "M" written in his own blood. Another shot of
  morphine would have killed him. But no one really thought it
  mattered: Doctors said he wouldn't make it anyway.</font></p>

  On the Road to Recovery</b></font></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">He was paralyzed
  from the neck down. They sent him to a nearby military hospital
  and put him in a full-body cast. After a few days, the Army
  shipped him to Kansas - so he could die near his home. But Bob
  Dole was never one to give up. And he did not give up then.
  Slowly, with agonizing effort, sensation came back to his legs
  and left arm.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Then he caught a
  fever that just would not go away. 108.7 degrees. His mom told
  the rest of the family that Bob would not make it through the
  night. They called a chaplain. Doctors made a last ditch attempt:
  A kidney operation and a shot of penicillin. He rebounded and his
  long and hard journey to recovery had begun.</font></p>
