  <br>
  Thank you very much, Jim. Let me first give you a sports update.
  The Braves 1, Cardinals nothing, early on.<br>
  I want to thank you, and I want to thank everybody here tonight.
  And I want a special thanks to my wife, Elizabeth, my daughter,
  Robin, for their love and support, and thank the people who are
  listening or watching all over America.<br>
  <br>
  In twenty days, you will decide who will lead this country into
  the next century. It's an awesome responsibility, and you must
  ask yourself, do you know enough about the candidates? You should
  know as much as possible about each of us.<br>
  <br>
  Sometimes the views have been distorted, and millions and
  millions of dollars in negative advertising have been spent
  distorting my views. But I hope tonight you'll get a better feel
  of who Bob Dole is and what he's all about.<br>
  <br>
  But I think first, I should understand what the question on your
  mind is, do I understand your problem? But I understand that if
  it occurred to me, and I might just say that I'm from a large
  family. I got lots of relatives. And they're good, average
  middle-class, hard-working Americans. They live all across the
  country. They're not all Republicans. Maybe all but one.<br>
  <br>
  But in any event, I understand the problems. Whether it's two
  parents working because one has to pay the taxes and one has to
  provide for the family, whether it's a single parent who just
  barely pays the pressing bills, or whether you're worried about
  an education for your children, going to the best schools, or
  whether you're worried about safe playgrounds, drug-free schools,
  or crime-free schools.<br>
  <br>
  This is what this election is all about.<br>
  <br>
  And hopefully tonight when we conclude this debate, you will have
  a better understanding, and the viewing and listening audience
  will have a better understanding.<br>
  <br>
  Thank you.</p>

  <p align="center"><b><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman">Bob
  Dole's Closing Statement</font> <font face="Times New Roman"
  size="+2"><br>
  <br></font></b> Well, let me thank everybody here at the
  university and Jim, thank you and all the people who may still be
  watching or viewing.<br>
  This is what it's all about. It's not about me. It's not about
  President Clinton. It's about the process. It's about selecting
  the President of the United States.<br>
  <br>
  So, we have our differences. We should have our differences.
  Mentioned other parties. They have their differences. If we all
  agreed it'd be a pretty dull place. We should have more debates.
  Maybe we'll have another debate on the economy. <b><font face=
  "Times New Roman" size="+2"><br>
  <br></font></b> But I would just say this - This is the highest
  honor that I've ever had in my life. To think that somebody from
  Russell, Kansas, somebody who grew up living in a basement
  apartment, somebody whose parents didn't finish high school,
  somebody who spent about 39 months in hospitals after World War
  II, somebody who uses a button hook everyday to get dressed,
  somebody who understands that there are real Americans out there
  with real problems, whether they're soccer moms, or the single
  parents or families working with seniors or people with
  disabilities, whoever it may be - but there are some very
  fundamental differences in this campaign.<br>
  <br>
  President Clinton opposes term limits. President Clinton opposes
  a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. President
  Clinton opposes a voluntary prayer amendment. He opposes an
  amendment to protect the flag of the United States of America.
  People give their lives - a couple of servicemen here, they
  sacrifice. They give everything for America. We ought to protect
  the American flag with a constitutional amendment. But beyond
  that, we need to address the economy.<br>
  <br>
  And I would just save my time, I'm running out here. It's a very
  proud moment for me. And what I want the voters to do is to make
  a decision. And I want them to be proud of their vote in the
  years ahead, proud that they voted for the right candidate, proud
  that they voted, hopefully, for me.<br>
  <br>
  And I'll just make you one promise. My word is good. Democrat and
  Republican groups have said Bob Dole's word is good. I keep my
  word. I promise you the economy is going to get better. We're
  going to have a good economic package and we're going into the
  next century a better America.<br>
  <br>
  Thank you. <b><font face="Times New Roman" size="+2"><br>

  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font size=

  <br>
  Thank you, Jim. And thanks to the people of St. Petersburg for
  fantastic hospitality, and my friend, Al Gore, for a vigorous
  debate.<br>
  I think this is the most exciting time in the history of the
  world to be alive. We have lived through what Jean Kirkpatrick
  called the bloodiest century in mankind's history. We have
  defeated, in this system of ours, fascism, Naziism, communism,
  socialism is defunct or debunked around the world, the evil of
  apartheid has ended. There's only one last question remaining for
  the next century, indeed, the next millennium - Can we in America
  make the world's greatest liberal democracy, this democratic
  experiment in private property, limited government, the rule of
  law, respect for families and traditional Judeo-Christian values
  work so it can be a blessing to our country and a blessing to the
  rest of the world?<br>
  <br>
  With all due respect to this administration, they've got a
  foreign policy in disarray. They have a lack of credibility
  around the world. Weakness, as I said earlier is provocative, and
  clearly this economy is not performing up to the standards that
  we would expect from this great nation going into the most
  exciting global economy the world has ever known.<br>
  <br>
  There's something amiss. Our culture seems to be weakening all
  around us. Families are under tremendous pressure. People do not
  feel safe in their homes. A mother doesn't feel safe sending her
  child to school. Our schools are not educating. It's not the
  problem of the teachers - they are overworked, and my daughter
  will tell you they're underpaid. And we know that. They need to
  be empowered.<br>
  <br>
  We need to reform education. We need to reform welfare. We need
  to reform litigation and regulation. And we certainly need to
  reform this tax code that is a product of this terrible century
  of war and recession and inflation.<br>
  <br>
  It can be done. We need somebody who understands the potential of
  the American people, that we're not just doing well for
  ourselves, we need to do well for the rest of the world because
  they're looking at us and we need to make it work in every
  neighborhood and community in America and for every family so
  that no one, as Bob Dole said in his San Diego acceptance speech,
  is left behind.<br>
  <br>
  Bob Dole, as I said earlier, is a man of courage, a man of
  principles, a man who crawled out of a foxhole in 1945 to save a
  wounded brethren.<br>
  <br>
  The Bible says, "No greater love hath a man than he give his
  life." Well Bob did, just about. He's been through the valley of
  the shadow, and he, as commander-in-chief can take this country
  with the courage of Churchill, the principles of Lincoln, and the
  indefatigable optimism and spirit that this nation expects from
  its commander-in-chief and the next President of the United
  States, Bob Dole.</font></p>

  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Thank you, Mr.
  President for those kind words. And I thank the people of
  Hartford, the Commission, and all those who out there who may be
  listening or watching.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">It's a great honor
  for me to be here, standing here as the Republican nominee. I'm
  very proud to be the Republican nominee, reaching out to
  Democrats and Independents. I have three very special people with
  me: my wife Elizabeth, my daughter Robin, who have never let me
  down; and a fellow named Frank Carafa, from New York, along with
  Ollie Manenan, who helped me out in the mountains of Italy a few
  years back. I've learned from them that people do have tough
  times, and sometimes you can't go it alone. And that's what
  America is all about.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">I remember getting
  my future back from doctors and nurses, and a doctor in Chicago
  named Dr. Kelikian. And ever since that time, I've tried to give
  something back to my country, to the people who are watching us
  tonight.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">America is the
  greatest place on the face of the earth. Now I know millions of
  you still have anxieties. You work harder and harder to make ends
  meet and put food on the table. You worry about the quality and
  the safety of your children - the quality of education. But even
  more importantly, you worry about the future, and will they have
  the same opportunities that you and I have had.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Jack Kemp and I
  want to share with you our ideas tonight. Jack Kemp is my running
  mate and he's doing an outstanding job.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Now, I'm a
  plain-speaking man, and I learned long ago that your word was
  your bond. And I promise you tonight that I'll try to address
  your concerns and not try to exploit them. It's a tall order, but
  I've been running against the odds for a long time. And again,
  I'm honored to be here this evening.</font></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman"><b>Bob
  Dole's Closing Statement</b></font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Thank you, Jim.
  Thank you, Mr. President. Thanks to everyone for watching and
  listening. I want to address my remarks to the young people of
  America, because they're the ones who are going to spend most of
  their life in the 21st century. They are the ones who have the
  challenges, and there are people out there making predictions
  that it's not going to be the same, you're not going to have the
  same opportunity, it's going to be more deficits, more drugs,
  more crime, and less confidence in the American people. And
  that's what you're faced with, what parents are faced with and
  what grandparents are faced with.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">It's important.
  It's their future. And I would say to those - I know there are
  more young people experimenting with drugs today than ever
  before, drug use has gone up. If you care about the future of
  America, if you care about your future, <b>just don't do
  it</b>.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">And I know that I
  am someone older than you, but I've had my anxious moments in my
  life. I've learned to feed myself and to walk and to dress, and
  I'm standing here as proof that in America the possibilities are
  unlimited. I know who I am and I know where I'm from, and I know
  where I want to take America.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">We are the
  greatest country on the face of the earth. We do more good things
  for more people in our communities, our neighborhoods, than
  anywhere that I know of.</font></p>
